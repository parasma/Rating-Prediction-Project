0,5,This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...
1,5,Good product as used of now.... Everything is good and also SSD slot is given for upgradation.... Only keys of Keyboard are not looking as reliable as other basic HP laptops....it has been a month now... I will use it for three months again and will update my review.....
2,5,AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much
3,4,"For that price... it's exceptionally good. Played Far Cry 4 at Ultra Graphics 1080p.. was super smooth. So was GTA V, Just Cause 4. So you can do pretty decent gaming. General PC performance is good. Photoshop 2020 (June) works perfectly and also other Adobe products. Display is super cool too. So yeah, a good system overall for that price."
4,4,"RAM upgrade is must do because the useable RAM is only 6GB, Ryzen 5 3550H is a great processor however eats up 2GB RAM in system, Due to that Heavy games like GTA 5 stutter, The FPS while gaming is good however stuttering happens when games doesn‚Äôt get enough RAM, Due to which I have to spend another 3.5K to put a 2nd 8GB ram stick. Rest all Is good Display is crisp Battey is good for gaming laptop anyway to play games chargers needs to be plugged in, Although the 5400 RPM HDD is quite slow m..."
5,5,It's good gameing laptop in this price Display is good battery backup is good And I like keyboard üòÅüëå
6,4,Best laptop in this price range... Believe me if you are willing to buy this laptop don't hesitate just go Nd buy it !! Booting takes 22 sec... If you want more faster then I will recommend you to go for ssd variant... Speed of HDD is not that slow people are reviewing aboveüôÑ... Nd wait wait wait people are also saying above ram is the problem only given 6 GB so every device have some pre installed software so non of the brand will provide u 8 out of 8 gbs ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è...there is no problem with the...
7,4,"The AMD APU is a disappointment. If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for. Other than that Gtx1650 is a beast and ryzen 5 will ..."
8,4,Okay so ive been using this laptop since a few days/weeks now and i really like it 1. The display is good 2. The Laptop runs smoothly 3. Upgradable which is a big pro 4. Great sound quality 5. beautiful build 6. Games work nicely Cons 1. A little bit slow but that can be upgraded using a ram and ssd 2. I play fortnite and rocket league on it and they run smoothly but sometimes theres a frame drop which again can be solved by ssd and ram  Overall i would really say this is a great laptop
9,5,This is my 2nd laptop and ti be true i like it preety much. The booting speed is good and can be more if you install ssd in it.  Overall look wise it's awesome üëåüòç.  I played Apex legend in low graphic settings and it runs smoothly  The lappy can become a beast if you upgrade the ssd and ram ‚úåÔ∏è An additional of around 5k to 9k can be done to reach it's maximum potential. I'm happy with it üòä
10,4,Look perfect üíï Display is nice Sound quality is superb üíï Performance :- A little bit laggy... But if you upgrade with ssd then it gives you a good performance .. 5 day genuine review
11,1,"Flipkart and hp, I'm really disappointed in both you with this slow lagging machine. I have seen so many videos that told me that this machine is a very good option but even after spending 55k rupees in this dabba. I'm not even able to use Chrome on it. It's that slow. Yes, not even Chrome. HP people are you sure, you are one of the best companies. You have made this lagging box, just so i can regret trusting you again. I thought maybe 55k is enough for me to get a decent laptop for daily use..."
12,4,"The true potential of this thing is unleashed when it's plugged in. Don't even bother to game on this thing on battery only. Battery backup about 5 Hrs on normal uses like browsing, video streaming etc with both wifi and Bluetooth ON.  2GB out of the 8GB RAM is reserved for Vega 8 which is a real bummer. So another RAM of 8GB 2400 MHz is recommended at slot 2.  Pair it with an SSD ( ofcourse nvme recommend ) and feel the difference.  Be sure to download GeForce Experience.  Update all the dr..."
13,1,"Don't ever buy this laptop , the description says it's a gaming laptop but it can't handle games like gta 5 and goes into hibernation mode within 5 minutes of the game and out of the 8gb ram only 5.9 gb is available and performance is not that slick , hence would advise anyone looking to buy this , avoid it and spend extra and get yourself a better laptop"
14,5,"Good packaging, right on time, gorgeous design and lovely performance, best buy for beginners"
15,4,Nice product Battery mostly 4 to 5 hours But performance was very nice 4 star for late delivery otherwise product was very nice at this price Booting take normal time but its good in hdd Because sdd was fast comparable to hdd I think this is the drawback Company needs to modify ssd on this product
16,5,This review is after using this laptop for 6 months. Display:10/10 Performance:10/10 Battery:8/10 No heating issues No fan noise while normal usage Suggestions: 1.try to add extra 8 gb ram.because amd integrated graphic card uses 2gb of ram and available ram is only 6gb. 2.try to add 500gb ssd and move your os to ssd. Then you laptop enters into beast mode  Overall great laptop with amazing specs. Blindly go for it.
17,5,"This is an initial impression review. The battery life, display and design are above par. Gaming experience is terrific with a good, strong card inside. The issue might be the 2GB RAM reseved by RX Vega which is the inbuilt mobile gpu of Ryzen. All in all, a good package and a great value for money. My suggestion would be to install an ssd and an additional 8 GB RAM in the near future to get the most out of the product. Note : Disappointed by flipkart for not putting in bubble wrap in the pa..."
18,5,greate deal for the price to performance ratio. for gaming it is good but only one problem it heats up quickly so for better you should keep it on cool surface for gaming . Other things are exellent. 'I loved the experience
19,5,Product is excellent but battery is draining is lot faster than I expected but it is above average. Overall product is good and I think you also get what you paid for. I am happy with laptop.
20,1,"Sorry, after 2 months of buying now....I am thinking why I bought this laptop ....I recommend don't buy you can go with intel instead of ryzen ...I bought it for coding and designing purpose but yet I haven't installed such softwares ...still it is getting hang while watching yt on it ... just like our Android get if memory gets full ...and also some time sentence of some part getting on screen adruptly ....design and display of lappi is excellent but had performence ...."
21,4,Good product performance really awsome and powerful battery life...üòáüòáüòç.. I like it very much
22,4,It is having a wonderful build design ? Build quality is really good Bcoz of not having ssd it's not that fast in opening files apps and softwares It doesn't gets too much heat Overall satisfied with the product
23,5,"Overall this is best buy in this price range. Only issue I found that it has 5.9 gigs of Usuable ram out of 8 gigs because of integrated amd graphics. It gives approximately 40 to 60 fps in high end games like watch dogs 2, gta v, Witcher 3 at high settings. Battery is decent, display quality is good....."
24,5,It is a bit slow.... If you want faster experience install ssd in it. It has SSD slot or you can go for SSD variant.Other than this all are woking good. I think this may not be a big problem. I loved it.... The gaming experience is so nice...overall performance is good..
25,5,Good Experience with this Product. For better more smoothness and for better experience upgrade add 256 GB SSD in it .
26,5,"I am using it for a day what i have noticed is it gets a little hot from the bottom right but it's manageable. The screen is beautiful, backlit keyboard makes it total worth the price. I bought it for 48,875 and it delivers really good specifications and quality. Overall it's a great product if you're getting it under 50k. If not then you should wait for some Flipkart sale."
27,4,It's small...Design good...Clarity awesome....Performance is good after 1 week use...Battery charges fast and stands nearly 6 hours for normal use ...One minor problem when it's charging we can't use the mouse touch pad smoothly...It's jumping and lagging....Better use separate mouse like i do...Just cause 3 plays very smoothly...Only 6 gb ram we can use as a default... Over all its a good one ...
28,4,"The laptop in short is a beast.For peaple owning a laptop for the first time,it would be bliss.It has many flaws(with HDD).But for those who are willing to take care of their laptop,it will work like a charm. Overall,I would say just to go for it."
29,3,"One of the best budget gaming laptop loved it üòò. Smooth performance, good graphics card but it would have been better if there were other colors of RGB lights on the keyboards and u cannot change the color of the keyboard lights. But good laptop beast performance."
30,5,"Excellent laptop for professional as well as gaming purpose. I am writing this review after 1 month of use. First when I got the product it was not the proper product as the OS was having some problem. But immediately hp service man have checked and cleared the problem. I am using this laptop for design purpose. I use to work with AutoCAD, CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, etc. These applications are running super smooth and speed in this laptop. However if you are using this kind of high end applications ..."
31,5,"I am writing these reviews after using 3 months of using this laptop.  Points: 1. RAM capacity is 8GB. If you want to enjoy gaming, atleast install 16GB RAM. 2. I played games like AC Valhalla, GTA 5, RDR 2, Days Gone, Witcher, AC Oddesey, watch dogs 2 and many more. At the highest graphics settings you can sense some lag, but good for mid range graphics. 3.Heating Issue: Yes, this can heat up a lot, but to mention gaming laptops use graphics so that is natural. To use the most out of laptop,..."
32,4,Product is awesome I m fully satisfied with the product. Display quality is superb But the delivery experience was not so good took almost 15 days to deliver the product..
33,5,"I have been using this for a week now. Short answer, just go for it, the best non chinese laptop under this price segment. I brought it for 48k. I have seen most of the reviews saying performance is not great. First things first you have to plug in while you are gaming otherwise you won't be getting the peak performance or just set battery to best performance while you are not plugged in.  Boot time with HDD: Again I have seen many reviews saying it takes around 1 and half minute to boot ..."
34,5,Performance was awesome .....it has Amd Rhyzen 5 3550H processor which has slightly lower base clock speed of 2.1 GHz but that works much better than Intel Core i5 9th gen and also neck to neck i5 10th gen....some said it was also better than i7 9th gen ....which I can even realise when it renders videos within minutes in DaVinci Resolve which is most renowned video editing software and heavy software in the industry...but that is only possible with an extra installation of M.2 Nvme SSD from...
35,4,"Ok, so I have a lot to say. First of all, I ordered this laptop for my sister on 7th Nov. My father purchased it and it was fast delivered. Coming to packaging. Flipkart terrible packaging from the outermost. When we first unboxed it the hp package was perfect in condition. The laptop was fresh as anticipated. It was perfectly sealed. Ok now coming to the product. I'll say it directly. Pros Display-15.6 perfect if you want a big screen and got bored of a 14 inch one Processor-a ryzen 5 3550h..."
36,5,"Pictures don't do justice.. Product is awesome and built quality is too good. Looks premium. Upgrade to ssd for most of this beast.. Display is awesome. Backlit is good. Purple is better than >>>red, white.. I have used many of them... Battery is 4 hours.. Overall it's a beast under 50k..  If u are getting it under 55k go for it..  Out of 8 gb ram 6 gb ram is what we get.."
37,1,It might have great specs but it is slower than 4GB Ram laptops my friends are having. If you are from computer science background tell me how much time should a system take to import a small library like pandas mayb seconds. But it will take 2-3 minutes. It is that slow. Trust me.
38,5,"Actually it's good ,no problem yet .just update your windows and it will became more fast. You can also add ssd and ram if you needed. Look wise it is great and battery charges very fast due to 150 watt charger.  Actually it's perfect if you add ssd and ram"
39,4,"I bought this laptop for a balance routine like moderate gaming and normal work, and i have no complaints. The battery backup is really good of around 4hrs 30min to 5 hrs. The keyboard is well lit and you have no problem seeing the buttons even in dark room conditions. Ive been using this for 3 months now and I HAVE NO ISSUES with it. Do keep in mind that this comes with the TRIAL version of Microsoft Office and not the full version. It comes with McAfee antivirus which does a really good j..."
40,5,"Very Good Packaging. Product safely kept. Received the product in good condition. Clean Stuff. Only problem is the RAM, 6GB is only usable out of 8GB"
41,4,Best at this price range only compromising thing is its ram but 6 gb ram also handle many AAA titles with ease but you may notice some of very high end titles sttuter like GTA 5 because of ram if you upgrade your ram to 12 gb or 16 gb then you will get the real performance of this lappy ....no frame drops after upgrading and handle 70% new games with 60fps ij high setting .....
42,4,"I bought this laptop 7 days back and according to my, this laptop is pretty good .let me first talk about the design, so the design of this product very good and the performance of the battery is also nice but I don't like the keyboard because of the LED light you will not able to see the letters present on the keyboard and the final one is speed. In my case, the laptop speed is a little slow. If you add SSD then it will become more fast. so then thank you for reading my review."
43,5,"Boot time is a little slow but other than that I have know complains. Solid build quality, great screen, good speakers, respectable battery life, bang for the buck gaming performance. Overall very satisfied"
44,3,"The design and the user experience is best in class. But, it is quite slow. Even simple activities take longer time to respond. Also, would have been great if it had a Touch screen instead of a regular screen. Overall, I am happy except for these issues."
45,5,"Its been 2 weeks I am using the laptop, upgraded with 8 GB more RAM and it works like a charm, all the AAA titles of game runs smoothly on it - The game you name it and this beast will play it like charm, overall a great choice for official use also - For Work from home. To unlock the beast do upgrade with 8 GB ram and 240 GB SSD and it will run faster than any other laptop in this price range. Great value for money, Looks are awesome. Great choice."
46,5,pretty cool design the performance is really good the battery performance is good and it really charge very fast comparing to another laptops if you are seeing a laptop under 55k you can go for it
47,5,Amazing Laptop Loved it I upgraded the 256gb Western Digital Nvme SSD into it which make it's performance next level Booting time reduced from 40 seconds to 18 seconds. Recommended to install ssd to get real performance
48,4,Overall This Laptop Is Great But Someone Who Want Something Perfect I inform You That For Ame Lovers Its gReat thing as 4gb graphics and 8 gb ram is spectacular on the other hand battery drains quickly when you play games its important to plug in charger while playing  Screen size is small compare to others but its budget friendly so no offense  Need ssd for the fast startup and game lags due to it when power supply is not connected  I lost my battery sign on the taskbar so if anyone know how...
49,5,I ordered this laptop a month ago and I really love it So this review is for those who aren't sure if it's worth it well to be honest it has a average battery in terms of me rating it But it is really fast and the screen is really good Design wise and performance is really good It comes with a ryzen 5 processor and gtx 1650 Graphics card Which is really great Especially for gaming U can play fortnite above 60 fps and 120 fps with no problem Go for it it's really worth it The only is...
50,4,"absolutely satisfied with the product. No ssd in this one but believe me it boots up in freaking 20 seconds. its just mind boggling. performance wise its descent handles my alll the tasks like a charm and it has got a good cooling system as well. fan not so loud so . if u r having a strict budget around 52k just go for this, spending little more and getting a hexa core proccesor model 1021ax would be wiser though. go for it u wont be dissapointed.  Edit: if u buy this one here after do not uo..."
51,3,"Battery is pathetic, like I was getting free electricity in Delhi due to limited consumption, but this laptop sure gonna hike my electricity usage.  Laptop lags a bit , atleast 128 GB SSD should be given , and yes ram needs to get upgraded too , in order to have good performance.  Rest okayish product. For average usage."
52,4,Nice and best product as per specification but only battery backup is needed and i will suggest tjat if you are buying this product then please insert an SSD for smooth and better experience in it.
53,5,Very nice laptop for students and office work better that Asus and Acer We can play game at High settings to get 60fps Battery is very nice and laptop charges in 30-60 min Display is fantastic
54,4,"Dont judge proformance if u dont know how to setup gaming laptop for gaming 1.update all driver and bios,without this u will face lag and start saying wrost product. 2.setup window mobility or power plan to high proformance and also set best proformance in battery,this will give u constant high proformance for gaming even in battery.but if you are not gaming than set in power sever in battery life otherwise battry drained in 1-2 hours and start crying. 3.Due to radeon vega 8 gpu 2 gb ram wil..."
55,5,"Great gaming laptop in affordable price... Must buy for gaming lovers and content creators..   Pros: 1. Display is crisp and smooth 2. Processor 3. Upgradable with SSD upto 1tb and ram upto 32 gb  Cons: 1. Stock HDD is slow and it takes pc to start upto 3-4mins.(once I upgraded with WD SSD and copied the OS from HDD to SSD by WD disk cloning app, this problem cleared and takes me to windows within 10 seconds) 2. Games like GTA V can be played only when the laptop is connected to charger. Wh..."
56,5,Laptop is decent in terms of performance and gaming. Good display and processor for the price. Only con is less ram as integrated vega gfx eats 2gb so u get only 6gb. An additional 8/16gb RAM of 2666mhz speed from crucial can easily solve this problem. Also after 3-4 months the hdd will start acting up. This can be tolerated to some extent but if someone is looking to play games like Valorant or GTA 5 must upgrade to an 512GB SSD. Rest everything is working fine. Its a beautyüî•
57,4,"This is a good laptop.I played farcry 3,farcry 4 without SSD or ram upgrade.But BlueStacks lags.If you are a freefire player you can play lag free in smooth only.Charge don't last long.For gaming 10min it drops more than 20%.With charged only u get smooth fps.If u upgrade ram and SSD it may be good."
58,4,I write this review after using 10 days Design of laptop is excellent Especially display I loved it Battery is disappointing me Except battery all else fine If you are student then go for it Overall this is my first laptop so I love it One more thing performance is bit slow due to hdd If you want to play gt5 then you add ssd this boot your performance
59,4,"This is a decent gaming laptop, not recommended for high end gamers. However for casual gamers it's a nice option and performance is also good."
60,4,"The System is quite good in terms of processing power. The only problem is HDD, it takes ages to load anything. Be it booting or starting any heavy app. It takes a lot of time to run apps and to boot up. The same problem is true for most laptops with HDD as primary storage.  To overcome the long wait in boot time. I use the hibernate option provided by windows instead of shutdown. Hibernate keeps all your apps running and cuts of the power to the system. So the next time you turn it on, it's ..."
61,4,"Display and design are great hdd is slow i updated this ssd its very fast and battery is average but 150watt charges charges very quick, gaming performance while charger plugged is seamless i got it for RS.49240/- perfect deal im happy with it."
62,5,Awsome laptop. Only battery backup is a little lower but charges faster and windows 10 is genuine it is still awsome laptop.
63,4,"-Laptop looks great. -Display is awesome. -Those backlits are awesome man. We feel like watching the backlits turn-on the whole day. -Battery is below average to be frank. I get hardly 2:30 hrs backup. -Speakers are good, but not the best in this price ra"
64,4,"Review after 3 months !! If you really want a good display laptop,just go for it. screen display is awesome than asus vivobook and mi notebook. If you want a performance and speed then you really need SSD. without that it is average. Just normal gaming and takes a bit second to open apps and games. Bit SSD will make it a beast !! Overall m happy with the beast üî• no other laptop has such feature in this range. 1. Display 5/5 2. Performance 4/5 (bcoz of hdd) 3. Speaker 4/5 (it's decent) 4. L..."
65,5,It's awesome product.. it's completely fast working process and multi short cut touch and design its ultimate like this laptop . I lived it ... battery backup generally good. Once you completely charged ur working continues online 5hrs I think. As per price the product its better then other laptop.  But design its fibler related plastic. Otherwise the product have supper product I like it product.
66,4,This Laptop has a HDD which is really slow at booting...i would recommend you to buy a M.2 NVME SSD for Faster boot time and great performance...and also add up an 8GB ddr4 RAM for great performance
67,5,"It is just awesome laptop good design, excellent display,nice graphics It is an awesome product I just loved it"
68,4,"I am satisfied with it at this price.Smooth performance even without ssd , backlight is just awesome I loved it.this is best for overall performance wheather you want to play game ,do editing , everything you can do smoothly.must buy it."
69,5,Awesome Product. Really fast and reliable. Haven't played any games yet but it pretty solid with multi tasking. Takes some time to start up the first time but then later its fine. I preferred Ryzen 5 over intel because of performance and it truly delivers that performance.
70,4,I bought this laptop far a week now.. it was soo cool and amazing performance for this price range.The only issue is with the booting time gets more time because of no ssd.. and the battery is pretty good for my usage..and for great performance there is a M.2 sad slot you can easy add ssd and run os on that ssd it will boot fast and fast processing üî•..

71,5,In this price range this is better lappi and you can also option for upgrade your ram and also attached ssd for better performance but one demerit was processor 3350h if HP inbuilt 4600H processor this was AWESOME deal but over all performance was good . Display 5star Battery 5 star Processor 4star But if we attached SSD then speed and performance will increase but overall in this price range i will give 5 star after 20 days use ..
72,5,Very nice product must buy !!!!! *Performance is very nice.. *Battery backup up to 90min for gaming otherwise for small works 3-4hrs *Audio quality is good but not so loud. * Display also good even we can use in sunlight Over all nice product must by this.
73,4,"this laptop needs some extra ram to be installed after purchasing as it is slow in many ways and if possible have some budget after buying it to upgrade it with a ssd and ram then it is a beast. over all build quality is very good. the matte finish make it looks classy but at the same time attracts everything including dust, fingerprints so it needs some pampering. The keyboard backlit is very awesome and is eye catchy , sound is awesome, screen resolution is just best. battery is average jus..."

Best performance Best display Best Sound Best design Best battery backup Beautiful backlit keyboard Trust of HP service  Put ssd and increase ram yourself..

75,4,Overall I like the laptop and perferably perfer this one.  Pros: 1. Speaker quality is good 2. LED quality is good and great display 3. Keybord is nice 4. Battery back is nice upto 3 hours without games. 5. Laptop build quality is nice. 6. Cooling is very well. 7. Camera quality is quiet well. 8. Processor is at their best  Cons: 1. There should be an SSD in place of HDD ( In this price tag ). 2. There is lagging problem while playing games on battery mode.
76,5,"Ok, first of all this is gaming laptop, so if you are looking for gaming purpose then it's absolutely for you. Now Talking about battery performance then it's as usual like for all gaming laptops. Only thing is it doesn't come with MS office licence key. Overall laptop is worth it...üí• Have a nice day..."
77,2,"This review is after using for 1 week after installing all the updates and updating BIOS. This is a mediocre laptop. It just gets the work done. If you are purchasing this laptop, better get the SSD version or better get a SSD and upgrade RAM. The HDD version is really slow to boot up and takes 2-3 minutes after startup to function without stuttering. The initial 2-3 minutes after startup is really painful to use. My 2012 Dell laptop with HDD boots faster and can get to functioning properly ..."
78,4,Worth it guys go blindly for it but as its a gaming laptop battery backup is not nice but laptop design and other stuff are awesome
79,5,"Go for it , It is a budget friendly laptop with no issues.  You can upgrade in future :- 1)Ram (Upto - 32 GB,3200mhz)The information in product page is wrong. 2)SSD (NVMe)  Backlit keyboard is present at this cost only. The wifi is super fast also the bluetooth. The base speed of processor is 2.10ghz."
80,5,Best laptop for this type of specifications in this affordable price. And also good for Music quality.Display is good for quality videos . Performance is not so good.
81,5,"The only thing that I noticed is that it takes a little time to boot up. I have had used Lenovo before, beside being old it boots even taster than HP. Other than this I like all about it, when it gets little hot the two fans kicks in which makes me feel that I have a powerful machine. If you have more budget, then I would suggest you to go for Asus ROG. Which is too of the line product."
82,5,Good laptop with quite good display and features. Performance wise the processing is little slower than expected. Good buy at this price. Games run with good speed and efficiency.
83,4,This is best laptop for students. I really like keyboard and disin. Startup almost 10s. But super and amazing. Perfomance is specialy amazing. I konw ryzen is best than in intel.still i satisfied this product üòç
84,5,"This is my first higher price product that I bought from Flipkart. The seller was PETILANTE ONLINE. I was very much satisfied with overall everything. I literally have zero complaints. The package and the delivery was all perfect and genuine. Coming to the laptop, it's the BEST machine if you're looking for a great gaming and also for other miscellaneous purposes. I never thought that online shopping would be a bliss. Thank you, Flipkart."
85,1,"Pathetic performance take ages to load the PC, had already replaced it once thought performance will be better in replaced version, it worked for a month now back to the same issue, booting takes a life to load? I also bought extended support with technician visit which does not work they want us to do all sorts of check by us before a technician visit can be arranged so pathetic support system. I won't recommend HP hardware."
86,4,I am writing this review almost a month After I have started using the product. As per the price it is an Ok quality of product. You can expect this quality of product for a range of 50k to 55k. I have got it on 48k inclusive of offers. Pros : 1.Got a very productive and effecient build quality. 2. Backlight Keyboard 3. Great 15.6 Inch Display. 4. Graphics card and Support 5. Rygen 5 Performance is great.  Cons : 1. No Microsoft life usability. It will ask you a license key. 2. Battery lif...
87,4,"Its takes a several minutes when its starting for first time. but after that it runs smoothly. Also the specification of RAM given here is 8 gb, yes its true.. but for daily(normal usage) you can use only 6 gb. Rest 2 gb is reserved. The best thing is The display and trackpad.  the thing which I didn't liked is that, it only has 2 usb ports which sometimes feels short when multiple devices needs to be connected. Pros: Best Display best nvidia graphic card ryzen 5 chipset Compact attractive b..."
88,5,Good trending budget gaming configuration. HP has hit a jackpot in this category and it‚Äôs sales have seen a huge demand for the price point... more than Omen series. Can use it for Design softwares as well as heavy Gaming... serves well for both. AMD Ryzen series of processors wont disappoint you... trust me!
89,5,The laptop is just a beast. I loved the design of the laptop the speakers and the keys are the top quality. The battery of the laptop last well for normal usage for like 6 to 7 hours. I received the latest hp pavilion model the wifi is the best and it can connect to a wifi and a ethernet cable together at the same time you can enable this feature from the omen command center you can download it for free from the microsoft store the laptop performance is also good i am using this from last 10 ...
90,3,"System starts very slow sometime 12 - 13 minutes. Not happy with that, and if you want to use any good software or number of process then 8GB ( in that only 5.8GB usable its a Big Note to anyone who's is buying laptop because rest of it will be used for video card as per the laptop stands) is not enough.  But don't worry you can buy DDR4 8 GB ram and install so the laptop will be real fast and that might cost another 4.5k.  Overall I don't feel it's good to buy for 51k. Rather I would go for ..."
91,3,"So I waited a LONG time to write this review. I have been using this laptop for about 10 months now and I feel that it is pretty good. It smoothly runs almost every game, and it is great for coding. I use it for literally everything, and it is a great experience. However, using this thing in the first 2 months or so was like the biggest disappointment. It was slow as hell, games did not run properly, and the boot took forever (still takes a bit of time). I contacted HP Support multiple times ..."
92,4,The product is best at this price ... The only con is it is a little bit slow because of hdd but can be corrected with 256 gb ssd ... So that will not be a big problem... Charging is very fast and battery life in normal usage is 4hours.... Overall good laptop
93,5,Highly Satisfied and value for money Laptop   7 months since I purchased this laptop and it works perfectly . Boot time was more since it has only HDD but when i installed SSD everything is just matter of seconds . Also upgraded Ram to 16 GB only I confirmed with HP service executive that the laptop Ram can be expanded to 32GB.   I suggest to confirm the Ram capacity with HP service center before upgrading the Ram

105,5,The product is amazing it is must buy from the Flipkart if you want to buy a laptop it is very amazing and it seem as shown their and the functions is also amazing it is superb but the problem is that the battery is getting low in a very short time so this was on the problem otherwise the laptop is amazing
106,5,Nice product and the delivery person was very good and give this item in just 1 day thank you flipcart for fast delivery
107,5,"I have been using this product for both gaming, online classes and movies ...it is awesome in all...not the beast performance but still good as it is budget laptop ....sometimes it freezes for no reason for 1-2 seconds , but my overall review is that my was spent well and it has value of money"
108,3,Battery performance is very awful...only 2 hours battery backup which is very irritating you have to charge it on every 2 hours which might be very disturbing for all of us and the performance is not so great ....apps like even simple apps take 5 min of time to open which is also very irritating and PC needs different types of updates time to time and it take 5 to 10 kin of time to open. Processor is good and graphic card and when you use PC for 4 to 5 hours it heats up like a very hot cooker...

111,5,excellent laptop with amazing looks and good price range. Just add a SSD to it and it's super fast.
112,4,"The hp pavilion gaming ryzen 5 laptop is a great option for a mix between business and gaming laptop. It has great design,good sound, great display.good battery and processor. The only downside is it doesn't come with a SSD which is a must for this laptop. It's a little slow without the SSD but since I had the SSD installed it's very fast. All in all a good buy at this price. Add 5k for SSD 500gb"
113,4,Design of the laptop is very good . Performance not that good because some high spec games like GTA 5 are lagging . Need to install a ssd and a 8 GB ram additional. But I think this is the best laptop in this price range as it offers Nvidia gtx 1650 . And also battery backup is also just ok not good .
114,1,Could be better. For solid works it's lagging. I don't know if it can support GTA 5 with ultra graphics. Audio is very disappointing..
115,1,Battery gets drained pretty quick you charge it to 100% and play for 2 hrs and that's it. Well coming to display you will be able to see screen bleed towards edges the processor is good for the price paid and overall you can play almost heavy games better if you add SSD to improve overall performance just battery and display is only concern rest all is pretty good for the price.

Don't know if u play heavy games!!)  -webcam is great.  -this laptop is a bit slower & its booting time is more which makes it look like its lagging. It should be more faster as it has an AMD Ryzen 5 ...

125,5,Great laptop especially fans for cooling. Add another 8 gb of ram and an SSD and then it'll skyrocket like no other. Fans do their work exceptionally well as the most important job of a gaming pc is cooling the system. Which is performed best in this price bracket.
126,4,"the laptop is great, an excellent buy for students and gamers alike.  the cpu and gpu work great in gaming and video editing. display size and quality is excellent. the keyboard feels really tactile and good to use. one of the con i found about this laptop is out of the 8gb ram, only 6 gb ram is usable ( 2gb ram is reserved for the integrated graphics). so i reccomend adding another 8gb ram stick for the best performance."

And the laptop battery was also not too long for general purpose we can use it for 3-4 hours or sometimes even less.

Although latest high end games like Devil May Cry 5 (2019) takes quite a toll on the ram often causing the game to lag if played for longer duration so my recommendation is to play latest high end games for less duration about 2 hrs not more than that.

161,5,I'm in love with this laptop üíúüíúüíú
162,1,Only purchase it if you're ready to spend at least 5-6k more on adding additional RAM and SSD. Without SSD it's dead slow. And you'll need additional RAM to play games as AMD keeps 2.1 gb RAM reserved so you get only 5.8 GB RAM available which is too low.
163,1,One of the least efficient thing I have bought from. Flipkart no doubt packaging is quite good But performance of laptop. Is mil. It's boot time is 3-4 times future We have to wait for 2-3 mins for google chrome or microsoft edge to start I think this is not gaming laptop this is waiting laptop all time just we have to. Go on waiting

169,5,Guys it's an superlap at this rate but after buying this u need to add SSD card and upgrade the ram nor will will cause u super lag u will hate this so do upgrade the lap I am writing this after use of 7 months I had lag issues before upgrade after upgrated that it's super nice to play games and stream with no lag issues so don't forget to add SSD and Upgrade RAM
170,2,Performing worse than my expectaions. Even my Dell Latitude 3400 works faster and smoother than this.
171,3,1) Real daily boot time is 4 minutes atleast. Don't expect to boot in 1 minute. 2) lags a little while using from first day. Opening of apps is not that fast. 3) hdd used in it is of toshiba company. Hdd is not good its speed is slow. 4) comes with mcafee antivirus of only 1 month. 5) ADDITIONAL RAM AND SSD IS MUST in this laptop !!!
172,5,Must Buy. Excellent product. Value for money.
173,2,"So this rating is for the laptop which comes in original condition without ssd. Before ssd laptop was performing below average and HP bloatware was dragging the performance down. So I installed a new wd ssd and migrate os in that ssd. Now the performance is improved alot. Machine boots in 7 to 10 seconds, copying speed is 22mbs/sec. And I am happy.  Laptop body is fingerprint magnet.  Recommendation- if anyone wants to buy this product install ssd in it. You will be happy."

The Hinge is quite rough to open. and it makes a tick noise. Also the ports side plastic quality making tick tick noises when touched. i checked in the service centre.

182,5,Today i have received the laptop..Thanks for flipkart team.. and we will write review the laptop workings after 15 days
183,5,"Don't buy the cheap words of people saying that it is a fraud of something. It is expected for radeon vega 8 to cover up 2 GBs of your ram. I've played cs go, fifa 21,etc and there wasn't much of heating issue. If you are a typical gamer, you should go for a higher laptop. I've got work of programming and modelling, and this product provides satisfaction. You could always a stick of RAM and M.2 nvme SSD for more performance any time you want."
184,5,a personal suggestion extend ram with one more 8 gb stick otherwise gta V lags alot
185,4,Over all Good.... Windows opening speed is low.. may be due to no SSD Thanks fr all trial version software development
186,4,"It's a good laptop you can play games in medium or low settings it can give you around 60 fps,but don't expect High quality gaming with High frame rate,Also if you upgrade the ram and add ssd to it you can increase its performance,the display quality and viewing angles are also good, overall it's a good laptop for its price"
187,4,"This product is good , value for money But after usage of 6 month , laptop will show some problems"
188,4,Performance is not good but after upgrading ram it's performance boosted after the upgrade the games are played very well.little bit slow but there is a solution upgrade SSD.value for money after upgrading it is the beast.fan noise is loud

190,5,Very good product and less price
191,4,It's a handy laptop for both performance and style. I have been using for a month now and I have zero issues with any of the spec or nuances around the laptop. Ryzen's quad core sure helps keep cpu usage below 50% even during hard core coding moments while I have 20+ tabs open chrome 2-3 heavy developer softwares running simultaneously and Spotify plays music. I have not played games with it so I'm not in a position to talk about the gaming aspects of the laptop.

200,4,Performance was improved after the updates. Battery is good Edges are sharp and it got me a few times. Not a problem while typing. Display is good Keyboard is single color with two brightness modes and off.
201,5,"Beast üòç 100% I Recommend to buy .Graphics 1650gtx üî•Long Life Battery ...all in one kind this Laptop ..work, travel,gaming suitable ..No heat while play 6hrs Pubg ..you need to careful on edges ..bezel less dat's only problem"
202,5,VERY AWESOME LAPTOP..  BEST LAPTOP IN THIS RANGE  VERY GOOD IN PERFORMANCE
203,4,Preformance + premium looks üíØ Go for it
204,4,The start up time seem to be a bit higher than usual where as the specs should be reducing the time to start. Initially I got a start up time of 20-25 sec to Login Screen .. which was really good. however it seems to be a bit slow now a days. Unsure of the reasons. Battery back is good. Display is beautiful. Very less heating issue. Gaming is good. Haven't done extensive gaming though. In-Built apps helps a lot.
205,1,This laptop is too too slow from 1st day.
206,1,"The worst investment done by me till date, the product is not at all upto the mark. It is said to be gaming laptop but it has problem of freezing you can't do work as well. Its my worst experience till now in all the laptop i have been used. And if you are going to buy laptop please don't buy ryzen go for another processor."
207,5,"I have used this laptop for a month, the windows that installed on hard disk is very heavy hence booting time is very high, i have reinstalled the deafult windows with bootable pendrive,now its fine for use ,now it take 15 to 20 sec to boot, performance in improved after reinstallation of windows."
208,5,My first laptop purchase and it was the best. Yes off course it is slow but it is nothing that can be solved by an SSD a mere 120gb m.2 nvme can change this laptop a ultimate beast. I play Resident evil 7 and Batman Arkham Knight both perform very well in 1080p Max settings.
209,5,It's all things is good but battery backup is written there 5 hours but it not it's battery backup is is only 3 and half hours
210,3,"The laptop is slow! Really really slow. And this, without any new applications installed. Disappointing performance."
211,5,Awesome laptop
212,5,Just spend 5-7k extra to upgrade RAM and SSD and see your dreams come true
213,1,"Updated review.  Motherboard and battery replaced by HP. Charging is an issue. While using the system, it won't charge. Shutdown and it charges. Bad product  HDD doesn't help. It's slow than slowest. Upgraded with SSD and it became lightning fast. Make the SSD primary drive with OS installation. HDD can be back up one."
214,3,"Using this laptop for a week. Here are some things I noticed. Positive points:  Display is value for the money. Design is great, body looks awesome. After effects and GTA V runs like charms.  I do graphic design and rendering using Blender and it works fine I have no complains so far   Negative points: Cyberpunk lags so I had to uninstall. Problem in loading large Blender files Lag issues in using big graphic intensive software. Startup takes time, maybe buy an SSD version.  Not sure..."
215,4,"Been 4 months since I got this laptop and must say its been very impressive PROS are the price, the monitor(keep in mind I haven't seen a lot of other IPS monitors), the keyboard, The speakers(amazing) Build quality-made of plastic, but the plastic has a good feel Unique design Actually good selection of ports  CONS The above mentioned plastic is good, but it loves getting smudged and picks up fingerprints  HDD can sometimes be surprisingly slow in game loading 8GbB RAM but obv 2GB of th..."
216,1,Bought the laptop a week ago and it had already started to hang almost every time I switch it on
217,5,Laptop is superb.....ü§ûüî•ü§ô All laptop's give battery backup upto 3-4hrs. That laptop also gives same battery backup. I liked it's thermal cooling system. As the temperature increases the fan spped is increase. Cooling system is superbüî•üî• Design and overall other things are also good.
218,4,Performance is okay. Sound quality is superb. Display is good. The main disappointment is battery. Battery is draining fast

222,4,Good üëçüòé
223,3,It was good but sometimes apps like blender and fusion 360 are not responding I don't know exactly what the problem is but I downloaded the apps with lisence but why the are not responding nad battery backup is not up to the mark I think it should be get more backup and charging speed is okay..
224,1,"Utterly disappointed It literally takes 2.50 min to boot up and another 50 sec for system to set up. Even after read all the comments about its worst performance I made up mind to buy it and hoped I can manage. Now I feel how stupid I was. I am regretting everything now. What I have done to my self!!? It is very slower than my i3 laptop with 2 gb ram. I know SSD WOULD HAVE MADE IT FASTER, BUT REALLY DUDE THIS IS AMD RYZEN 5 WITH 8GB RAM COMMON ON!!!!.what will be more worse than having 8gb ra..."
225,4,Overall the laptop is good but after using it for 5 days the booting time is very slow but the games run good I would suggest you to go for extra 8gb ram and 250gb ssd.

Update- Pros Working fine 1. battery is still good on normal usage gives 7 hours backup and I don't play games on battery will not recommend anyone to do so plug in then play. 2. Hinges and keys are still in amazing state. 3. Thermal give good cooling. 4. Gets fully charged in 1 hour 45 minutes even is you are using it.  Cons 1. Thermal's outlets vent throws half of the hot air directly ...
280,5,SETISFIED IN THIS PRISE :-)
281,1,Sometime Touch Pad is not working
282,4,I got this for 45.5k using card offer best in that price.add SSD 256gb 3.5k and the laptop is beast
283,5,Best laptop in this range with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650
284,5,Working great. No lag. Quality good
285,1,"Display not work properly, need to change or rectified,   Bed Hp service, I want to return the product, any cost"
286,5,You should go for nvme ssd hardware or u can upgrade this then it would be beast
287,1,"Delivery is much delay ... Buy only for coding and other responses , not for gaming.. I recommend to upgrade ssd for gaming.."
288,4,Looks great n after use of some time I add my review
289,5,It was fantabulous inthis price range.The display and sound quality of this laptop is top-notch but little bit slow down which is negligible.Good battery backup and backlit keyboard.Iam happy with this.
290,4,Good For the decent Gaming And other user stuff...But cannot run highEnd Games smoothly without The Frame drops...unless You upgrade The Ram.
291,5,Awesome product
292,5,After ssd it is a beast goo for it
293,5,Mind blowing lappy.... I highly recommend just go for it....
294,1,Extremely Slow and poor performance! The specifications look impressive only on paper but the falsely hyped Laptop is extremely disappointing. It takes over 4 minutes to boot and several seconds to open applications. The battery life is around 1.5 hours so you have to rely on constant power to continue working. HP support is not impressive because the customer service team isn't technically qualified to resolve common issues. Would strongly advise against buying HP laptops.
295,1,heating issue lagging takes forever to load windows 50k wasted
296,5,Better to put SSD in it
297,4,"At first it didn't go well,Then I put an SSD, now it's going wellüòä"
298,4,"After 1 week of use my impression:  Perfomence: Laptop is slow compared to others devices at this range, maybe performance will be better after installation of ssd and increasing ram.  Battery: battery backup is descend. I will fully review this after a month or so.  Design: Design is really impressing.  Keyboard & trackpad: keyboard quality is good but trackpad is descend.  I will cover full review after a month or so."
299,5,"Good build quality Apart from HDD, everything is great. User can purchase SSD or buy SSD variant for more speed."
300,5,"It's a really great product, I would say go for it and it is also upgradable, so u can buy it if you want a lap for 4-5 years.  Till 1TB SSD can be installed And also extra 8GB ram can be installed (In total 16 GB)."
301,5,I got the 4 days ago this product is value for money buy it this is great deal and at this price this is beast laptop and plus point is Nvidia graphics card 1650 I love this product
302,1,Very bad to use on multiprocessing.
303,4,"Feels premium, looks premium and build quality is good"
304,5,awesome budget gaming laptop I'm so happy
305,5,It's really good. Performance is also good.
306,5,Good economical product

309,4,An awesome budget gaming laptop having a good processor but HDD makes its quite slow but all over its Excellent
310,4,"I donnow it takes 2.1 minutes to start only some times, i feel somehere d system is slow, may be bcz of No SSD, but still this shouldn't be this much slow, even opening photos, opening windows takes around 10 seconds some times even 15 seconds, for gaming this is the best....."
311,5,"Best laptop in this range Got at 46k only. Played Valorant without facing any problem Need to add SSD for rough usage, otherwise no problem in normal use with HDD."
312,5,I HAVE A PROBLEM ABOUT THIS LAPTOP NOT ABOUT THIS LAPTOP BUT ABOUT FLIPKART SERVICES FIRSTLY FLIPKART GIVES ME SURITY ABOUT I WILL GOT MY LAPTOP AT 18 OCT AND IT TAKES ONE MORE EXTRA DAY AND IT ARRIVES ON 20 OKAY THATS NOT A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS MY LAPTOP IS ALREDY SETUPED AND WINDOWS IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND ONE USER ACCOUNT IS CREATED ON IT AND SECURITY SOFTWARE IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND FOR CONNECTIVETY THEY ALSO ATTACHED JBL SPEAKER AND MANY MORE AND AND I CHEACKED LAST TIME WHEN ...
313,4,"I got this laptop only in 47,000 .... I am so happy with this product (till now) Battery last long about 5-6 Hr in normal video streaming"
314,2,"Performance is average, and the gaming performance too is not so good. I tried to install gta 5 and ith lags like hell even at low settings. The battery backup is also so poor."
315,1,Got a cheap and used product usb ports doesn't work well if you try to transfer any file from mobile or pendrive it will show you 24 hours of time and Internet doesn't work either please don't purchase it from this seller
316,4,Pros: Performance is really good Excellent configuration for the given price  Cons: Poor build quality No pre-installed MS office Battery last long for max of 5hrs unlike hp is claiming like 8hrs
317,3,Worst customer care experience. Even after 6 days of my complaint HP was even unable to find what causes the problem and I am still waiting for an explanation from them.
318,5,The laptop is an absolutely power package for the given price range and runs most games at a decent pace . Gta v has encountered a frame rate lag but runs almost smooth when service priority set high and framerate at 40fps. The absence of an ssd and an higher ram is an disappointment but the upgradable slots are a counter to the issue with an additional expense of 10grand will make up for an 1tb ssd with another 8gb ram . Overall very satisfied with product
319,5,Nice to handle
320,1,"Absolutely terrible laptop, gta v lagging even on lowest settings.  Quite possibly the worst purchase and very much a scam. The laptop itself does not have enough RAM to even run MS Paint without lag. Do not buy it under any circumstances."
321,4,This could have ssd card for faster operation and not having disc drive.
322,4,"Only 2 usb slots provided which is disappointing, battery backup is just ok sustainable not that great. Display is ok doesn't have a full HD vibe. Overall a good one."
323,3,Low battery backup upto 3.5hrs for normal usage
324,4,Laptop is overall value for money and u can play GTA V like games in very high settings. The main problem Im facing is its performance issue.but after installing SSD and Ram this laptop is working very smoothly u won‚Äôt regret after buying it. And finally the Thermals of the laptop @ max temp during GTA V was 84 degree and that is quite good so this laptop is very in thermals also u can play 4-5 hours continuously. üëç
325,4,It an good machine but one must add SSD before or after using it(without SSD it pretty much slow) SSD slot is available(M.2)
326,5,Great quality and good looking device.
327,5,Its amazing laptop with 55k budget..... Awesome experience with gaming..... Battery backup is good..
328,4,Everything is okay but sime times it got slowness as 2 GB RAM out of 8 GB RAM is already locked by system....just getting 20 to 30 seconds hanging
329,5,Best in price but must add SSD
330,5,Must buy product and amazing gaming beast at this price
331,3,Awesome product.
332,5,Nice one but require ssd
333,5,"product is so good just go for it. battery is good. display is awesome. graphics also awesome. it hangs some times , but after the windows update it is awesome. best laptop at this price"
334,3,Not bad
335,5,Perfect device in this price range
336,5,HP IS GREAT FOR LAPTOP AND PRINTER
337,1,Never buy from cheaters like flipkart
338,1,Worst laptop ever it started lgaing from day one and can't run basic games very slow and worst performance you expect from a gaming laptop. My money is wasted and now I can't return it. I am stuck with it . Please dont the mistake I did.
339,5,Totally good.. U always need charger for avoid lag and battery draining while playing gta 5 and other high games.. Also u need to add ssd. For better perfomence.. 8gb ram. But 5gb available.. Design and backlit is very good... Best value in money..
340,5,Little lagging problem otherwise everything is good üëçüèª
341,5,"Nice laptop in this range.. only one thing that the Laptop Speed is not great as per our expectations, but after update bios and Windows OS Speed increase from than previous speed...."
342,5,Better version but for better performance u need to update ssd
343,1,The Laptop is good But the Service of Flipkart is extremely poor
344,4,Everything is good but they are not giving SSD.. Almost all companies are giving SSD in this price..
345,5,"I have used this laptop for more than one month and have not faced a single issue in it..I have played gta 5, did video editing in premiere pro, coding, used Adobe Photoshop and everything was working absolutely fine.. But if you want more smooth exotics l experience you can just upgrade the ram to 16gb and this laptop will become beast..i myself upgraded to ssd 500gb and 8 gb Ram and now the performance is best"
346,5,Amazing laptop and a pure beast at this price segment. No lag or heating issues and battery lasts easily for 4 hours on normal usage. Got it within a day and far above my expectations. Just add an m2 SSD and additional 8 GB 2400 MHz RAM and it'll be the best thing ever.
347,5,"I edited my review after the heavy use like(working on Revit Architecture software).After installing Revit I especially feel it is laggy but if you add SSD then it works fine. Takes time for opening after shut down thats why I keep my pc on sleep mode in day time and shut down only in night. I expected little more in this price range becoz if you invest 55k money in any pc and you will feel disappointed with its functionality,, it is not fair."
348,5,Goodüî•üî•
349,5,It's adorable
350,5,Got it at 43.5k in ugadi sale Good laptop and build quality good
351,1,performance too much slow. don't buy this product .it's waste of money
352,4,I had installed the SSD coz hdd is slow overall it's good
353,5,Fast delivery and design is very good. It haven't SSD so little bit slower for use. But overall good.
354,1,"Never seen a laptop slower than this. Forget gaming, you can't even browse internet on it properly."
355,4,Overall best product. One star deducted for late delivery
356,4,"Can't call this a gaming laptop!! It sucks üò°üò°üò° can't play gta5 properly, it lags, fps drops... worst performance!!Really bad experience!"
357,5,Game will run smoothly if charger is connected üòâ
358,1,The product is not good with 6 gb ram but if you add another 8 gb of ram and 256 gb of ssd then it is a beast.
359,4,"There are only two USB ports.HP should have provided at least four USB ports.Also,cooling ports for the cpu seem to be delicate.Over all a good package.Flipcart packing and delivery top."
360,1,The main reason for giving just one star is nothing but their amd on board gpu which reserves 2gb of the total ram in the system which seriously affect the gaming performance. Overheating is another issue.
361,1,"I dont know what the issue is but the performance is very very poor,the booting takes almost 45sec,games are unplayable,also it crashes a lot. For some weird reason the usable ram i get is only 5.88 gb out of 8gb. Opted for the return option,but weirdly flipkart has only replace option,that too with only the same product. My friend just bought the same product,he is facing the same issue! Update:- received the replacement unit, still a shitbox,slow af,i guess the whole lot is defective"
362,1,Very slow laptop
363,5,Good packing‚ù§Ô∏è Best customer service‚ù§Ô∏è Budget laptop
364,1,Don't buy this model. Boot time is above 3 min and the laptop is laggy
365,5,"Best Laptop, I got it for 48897 Good graphic performance feels a bit slower because of AMD Ryzen 5 3550H and no ssd alongwith. display is good battery backup is good sound quality is average It is a light weight laptop around 1.8 kgs looks very stunning"
366,4,Display good Performance is some Butter It is suitable for only students Not for gamers . But keyboard backlight I'm impresse I am Getting windows licence problem
367,1,Battery back up has been reduces to 2 hrs with in 2 weeks and laptop charge rate is 6% per hour
368,1,"Modern laptop need more fast processing ...but my laptop, haha even lots of upgrades I still found it's like 13 processor...it's very slow processing I am a bit unhappy ,it takes nearly 10 minutes to start,...which system now a days take 10 minutes to get in track ."
369,1,The worst purchase I ever made
370,4,"This is a value for money laptop. I bought it for video editing and boy it does the job so nicely. And I think it's targeted for that exact group, because I think for really high end game it will run short especially with only 6 GB allocated memory. It does take bit long to reboot and you won't find any high performance in normal day to day tasks. But in high end tasks like video editing it comes to life and takes 10% time of what it used to be in my older laptop. I got it at 49k, I think it'..."
371,1,Just to sell the ssd they make made this hdd thing a joke.. If u r willing to spend about 10 K more then only buy this one otherwise find something else. The boot up time and the performance it gives is jst unacceptable. Even opening Google Chrome takes ages
372,3,After one year the system becomes very slow. Initial starting take 3 minutes. Opening and closing application too slow. Low performing laptop
373,1,"Don't waste your money on this ,I am writing this review after 1month of usage, it crashes almost every time ,can,t even watch YouTube on chrom properly , always crashesh, I buy this laptop for gaming and video editing, now I am regretting ü•≤,PLZZ don't buy this"
374,1,It is worst phase and you can say experience of online shopping there is nothing which justify its cost and specifications.This is also a old model so u can buy some new arrivals of any company with great experience.
375,3,"Please don't buy this product, performance is very bad. Start and shut down is taking too much time.We will go mad."
376,1,Disgusting service from Flipkart and HP.....they stuck my money......third class product they sell
377,1,Very slow laptop not working fast
378,1,Worst product ever and i had a worst very bad experience ordering with flipkart the customer care is not helpfull . No one ever listens to the customer
379,1,Boot time around 2mints every time and profomnce not good
380,5,"I was sceptical before buying, but I received a brand new stock, Jan 2021 in February itself. The packing itself was untouched from factory. We bought two, and I asked my daughter about the performance, she gave everything 5 stars and for battery 4 stars. Overall we are happy about the purchase after using it for over a month."
381,1,Laptop is getting slow while charging... started after onemonth of purchasing... not getting any help from hp after compalining multiple times... hp is reallyy worse for me
382,4,I am using this laptop for 5 months now. It is incredibly good have also give me 140+FPS during gaming. I mostly plays Valorant and it really runs well. But sometime it performs slow whenever i open up any IDE for coading. I am a CS Student and i like to code a lot but sometimes it lags during debugging and compilation of the code. Maybe its because of SSD. I will edit my Review after I install a ssd in it. Maybe after a month or two.
383,5,Beast Product Tested FALL GUYS - 61-75 FPS ON HIGH SETTINGS MINECRAFT - 50-61 FPS ON FANCY SETTINGS NO LAG GTX 1650 IS BEAST RYZEN 5 3550H IS ALSO GOOD
384,5,Good Laptop for gaming and software coding  Pros Backlight keyboard 6Gb graphic card amd + Nvidia 2 ram slot 1 used and 1 in free Amd Ryzen gaming chip  Cons No ssd so we can add ssd also Only 6 gb ram When installing heavy game cpu get 100% so laptop get hanged
385,1,Take so much time for booting... Too slow
386,1,This laptop is broken down within a month
387,1,I received a defective piece which is not getting on. Display is completely defective. I received this item as gift and hence took 20 days to unwrap. Now Flipkart says you only have the option to contact HP helpdesk. Really purchasing expensive items online for Gifts is risky because 7 day return policy gets overs till the time gift is unwrapped
388,1,Worst laptop and worst service by Flipkart
389,1,Too slow.. I used only 1weak.. The Performance is very slow..
390,4,Performance is good and look is awesome but sometimes the hing is producing sound in turbo mood

393,5,Product was good and there is no doubt about Flipkart. I am very happy with this product.
394,1,Laptop is getting strucked when I use it for more than 3 hr
395,4,"4 star is only for in this price they can add a 120gb ssd. Because of hdd machine is lagging to much, response time is high. Others all good."
396,4,The only problem is ram. I was only provided with 6gb of ram and there is no option in bios to free the ram. Else every thing is good.
397,1,Very slow pc . Apps take a lot of time to open not even Games running properly. Worst laptop ever I recommend not to buy this pc
398,1,This is the worst purchase ever. Dont buy this product. It is slow as a slug and will not respond at times when we need it the most
399,1,"The f7 key is already broken and the amd is not upto the mark , its processing very slow . It takes about 3-4 minutes to turn on ,,,, just go for msi its better than this at this same price range"
400,1,Very bad product  It‚Äôs super slow and takes 20 mins to start.  Never expected this from a brand like HP‚Ä¶
401,1,"Getting very slow after every 2 or 3 month. Don't purchase, if anyone going for this product"
402,1,its too slow after 3 months of use
403,5,Expect SSD all features are great
404,4,Nice product allover is good but ssd is important
405,1,Better to go for acer aspire 7 or ssd variant...I am Facing lot of issues. Worst perfomamce..
406,1,The worst laptop you can ever buy it has ram issues hp support also not able to fix my solution and you will only get 80 90 fps in valorant

409,1,Bit battery backup is low
410,1,Worst model
411,1,"Laptop is tooo slow on both off and on, lag while watching movies, lag on process, many apps and software are not responding"
412,1,"Very bad item, it's got stuck every time and responding time is tooo large it's totally waste of money pls üôècheck before you buy"
413,4,Good performance.
414,1,Some of my internal parts are replaced by other quality less old parts .I just found out this today when I just opened it because of its very poor performance and I was shocked.if I found out earlier in the time of before replacement surely replaced it.and I would never buy a another product from Flipkart because then will never hesitate to fool me again
415,1,‚Ä¢The Processing speed is very slow ‚Ä¢Booting and Loading takes much time ‚Ä¢Overall looks are good   Is this because of the running of automatic windows updates !???
416,1,Not buy this product Buy ssd laptop
417,1,Worst laptop don't buy it at all
418,1,Poor laptop
419,1,In last 6 months it has crashed twice. How can HP make such a product
420,1,Flipart People are frauds.
421,1,Speed Not good.
422,1,I been using these product it's completely slow not worth of money you may regret after buying these product
423,1,"Slow working battery drain,"
424,4,Super laptop at this price range...must buy no issues yet...
425,1,"Performance is pathetic while working with AI or photoshop. I think Flipkart is worst in handling fake product supplier, I think Flipkart actually receives handsome margin through supplier that‚Äôs why promoting it through its platform"
426,5,"This is a, budget gaming laptop"
427,5,Nice laptop
428,3,Best product
429,1,Waste of money
430,1,"Very poor laptop from HP. The design itself is faulty as the charging point location is bound to create problem due to its positioning on the laptop. Battery itself has been ok but it is difficult to get it charged. Display is ok but again due to design the screen panel vibrates even with the fan speed. With such impressive specifications the laptops takes too much of time to boot. This is for normal functions, i havent even used it for gaming purpose yet. Charger seems to be a cheap third gr..."
431,1,Very bad
432,5,If you add SSD then it becomes beast
433,1,The performance of a brand new unit was pathetic. The purple backlit sucks. The font on keyboard is not comfortable. Had to run a check with HP assistant. I dont recommend
434,2,"Not good. After idle time close the laptop does not open and have to forcefully shutdown the laptop . Also, taking more time to start and open."
435,1,Bad hp company Westez money

440,2,2 months it will work nice after that üôÇ
441,2,The laptop is very slow and it gives only 20-30 fps on gta v 720p resolution
442,4,Best laptop@48465/- i just fall in love with this beast one!!!!!!!
443,4,Good if you extend ram and ssd
444,4,Except battery all features are good.
445,5,With extra 512 gb SSD and 8gb ram this laptop is beast under 50k
446,5,I love it just an amazing ....‚ù§Ô∏èüí´
447,4,Best laptop for gaming after upgrading 16 gb ram Because very lag in gta 5
448,5,Perfect Laptop for gaming! must bye
449,5,"The laptop was super awesome, but just one little problem, there is no screw to install SSD, they must need to provide screws for SSD. I collected one from old laptop, but had to use sandpaper to reduce the screw length. And also added a washer to hold it in place"
450,4,Really Satisfied ‚ò∫Ô∏è
451,4,Add ssd worth 3-5 k and it's beast at this price range Btw adding ssd do not violate the hp warranty
452,5,"Awesome product, amazing speed n performanceü§©üëå"
453,5,Very gud product
454,1,Nice but login slow
455,5,Good working
456,4,"Gaming performance is great but other than gaming, it's slow because it doesn't come equipped with SSD. If you can extend your budget go for SSD variant directly or you can just buy this one and install it later."
457,4,Performance isn't consistent . I think this may be due to processor or the updates for windows 10. Definitely needs SSD minimum 256gb coz the laptop feels incomplete without it . For consistency on performance and reduce the application load time or boot time. The way things are right now it's walking needs SSD to run.
458,5,This laptop can be bought only when you can afford another 10K on SSD and RAM upgrade. Otherwise don't go for it.
459,3,The Laptop is Very Slow(Installed Photoshop & coral) .. Need to add SSD in it...
460,5,Best one
461,4,"Nice performance, almost good"
462,5,U should definitely purchase this laptop as its a budget one... It does hav many features but i got the issue of booting time and slow opening of apps..... After that update it to your latest version and the laptop will work smoothly
463,1,"Received already used and defect product ,applied for return but it's mentioned more than 15 days for replacement"
464,4,"Everything is good but probably the worst HDD installed. You cannot game even when you get a perfect FPS because it takes time to load and retrieve the data from your hard disk. But for this price, if in case you have installed an SSD which costs around 5k for 500GB M.2 nVme then you can game or do something productive with no issues.  So an extra 5k is required unless you do not want to hard gaming on this.  The plus in this laptop is even when you game a lot with sufficient space and venti..."
465,3,"Major draw back is booting time takes little bit long ,and sometimes touch pad wouldn't work properly"
466,1,Very slow laptop. Dont go on configurations...the new laptop OS is very very slow. Pathetic. With time it became more slow
467,5,"Used it over an year.. Still running awesome. I am able to play games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Cyberpunk in high quality without any lags. Will recommend to add 8 gb ram more as it has 1 empty ram slot"
468,1,One of the worst experiences ever it's been almost over a year Very slow boot time Lag experience for gaming as well as general use It takes so much time just to open a folder
469,5,"Writing a review after 1 week usage. I am a surgeon by profession, needed a laptop for presentations, paper writing, some video editing. Design is terrific, gives a classy, techy look...especially the built quality, finish and backlit keyboard. This product is absolutely rocking performance wise... Intially it was lagging a bit then I updated the drivers. It started firing then, It's a complete setup for academic n educational purposes. If more needed I'll upgrade the ram n ssd..."
470,5,Best for 3D work
471,2,Never buy this laptop with hdd it's slow like tortoise
472,5,"Very good laptop. At first it's very slow, but you should add ram and ssd and then it's very fast. I added ram and ssd and now the booting time is around 10 secs. Very good laptop after upgrade."
473,1,"The windows 10 got corrupted, so i had to spend a ransome amount of money to install a new one, plus the sound system is not working, plus the camera wont open, totally disappointed."
474,5,Overall good performance
475,1,Forget about gaming.. not even good for normal office use.....Very very very very very slow... Waste of money ..
476,5,Absolutely love this laptop!!!!
477,3,Lap is too slow ... performance is too poor
478,5,Take more time to booting bcz of low rpm than normal HDD Only 5.9GB Ram is usable Sound is Good Good performance
479,4,It's a budget laptop. It has fullfilled all my requirements from playing fifa 20 to coding and installation of appium.
480,5,Bad
481,4,After purchasing the laptop it's speed was slow. Due to high graphics you will get 6 gb ram. And don't even think of playing high quality games without upgrading your laptop. But after 15 days of purchase... I bought a 8 gb ram and 256 gb ssd... After upgrading my laptop became very fast.... So u must spend additional 8k rupees for upgradation !!!
482,1,"very slow, buy ssd or don't buy at all"
483,5,"Value for money... After few setups and updates, it's working very smoothly. Battery backup is also good. Camera is also good . Sound system is quite satisfying."
484,1,very bad laptop not working properly do not believe in ryzen 5
485,4,Laptop is very good.. looking good.. design good...but it lags sometime...and it is slower than expected üò£üòî..So if You want a beast performance then upgrade it's ram and SSD... Battery is average...and this is my dream laptop..and now I have this dream ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
486,1,"The laptop is so good for doing ur daily works or multitasking and all. The only problem is i can't play games in this it starts to lag and there is a big fps drop. I don't know why it is happening. If anyone could please give me a proper ans, how to repair this problem i would be really greatful."
487,4,"Good laptop, But little bit slow. Looks like using an old gen computer.( I think this is making it slow ""New tech on old hardware type hddüòÖ)So I'll upgrade it lateron . All are saying that will make the performance much faster. I'll update the review afterwards"
488,1,"Defective product received Battery issues, Heating issue, performance issue, total waste"

496,5,This product is too good.... Must putchase it.
497,1,"Most pathetic, horrible laptop. It lags a lot. A chrome book is better than this. It takes 10 seconds to open firefox browser. When it comes to games...it lags like an old computer. Don't believe that this laptop is for budget gaming by going through the specs. It's a waste of money."
498,5,Best laptop for College students

500,4,Best laptop in th 50000
501,5,"Superb amazing product, 100% worthy. I bought it for 50000. But remember to buy an ssd. Battery life is up to 3 to 4 hr."
502,5,. So its not a major problem because it has Hdd in it if you install ssd in it will be faster and their will be no lag
503,3,"It takes around 30 seconds to boot, takes time to open any application so overall response time is somewhat more than expected. It doesn't feel today's generation laptop while using."
504,1,"Not a good laptop, built quality is low, very slow"
505,5,Overall laptop is very good but will need add a ssd to it and remember to update your graphic card drivers
506,3,Just need to add sdd and ram then it wll be beast
507,5,"This is the best laptop I've ever bought in my life till now. The only lack I feel is that they didn't provide MS office full version for permanent. They've a trial version of very short duration. Now even needs to buy the software separately, I feel the extra expense."
508,1,I got a hang issue from the beginning. Now its 3 month's and it's still the same
509,3,IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THEN GO FOR SSD MODEL OF THIS LAPTOP. THE HDD IS VERY SLOW AND SOMETIMES IT'S PERFORMANCE CRASHES. YOU CAN SEE LAGS AND THE BOOT TIME IS SLOW. RAM IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS PER THE GAMING LAPTOP. 2GB RAM IS RESERVED ALREADY FOR AMD RADEON GRAPHICS. WHEN YOU SEE THE TASK MANAGER THEN YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT ONLY AROUND 3GB OF RAM IS USABLE. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AAA GAMES LIKE GTA5 AND FARCRY THEN DON'T EXPECT IT TO RUN WITHOUT ANY LAGS AND SHUTTERING. OVERALL THE LOOK AND DISP...
510,5,"After one month of Laptop , i felt it is value for money. Only one trouble is that booting time is little longer. If we add a PCIe NVMe card this problem should get resolved"
511,5,"Best in its class. Ram & SSD upgrade is a must other than that no issues, battery üîã is fine ."
512,4,When system is starting than it will much slow open and its performance is also slow otherwise it was best its better also good

518,4,Need to upgrade SSD for smooth but performance with hdd is good for low end users
519,1,Works very slow manytimes real reviews after 3 months
520,4,Great product . But if possible get yourself a SSD and 8gigs of extra RAM then you will enjoy it at its full capacity. HDD is too slow. And other than that it felt value for money.
521,5,All features are very good ..but battery backup only problem ..less time working
522,5,Good
523,5,Just wow
524,5,In price approx 50000 the product is very good and performance is also good.

582,5,It is best laptop for gaming
583,5,Every thing is fine but slightly slow due to without ssd and extra ram
584,4,"After 1 week of usage. Should have gone for SSD is the only drawback. There's another slot for expansion, which is a good option. No lag issues and maximum boot time is between 2 - 3 seconds which is good for HDD these days. Ryzen 5 is just out of the box. Battery life is also good. We can manually enable 4K with AMD settings on the system."

617,5,One of the best laptop in this price segment(around 52k). Display is awesome. Just install any 256/512GB nvme SSD and it's performance would change drastically! Overall AMD Ryzen 5 3550H is a good processor for casual gamers.

628,1,Worst performance
629,5,You definitely need a SSD card if you buy this laptop. It has 2.1GHZ processor. If you buy this laptop for gaming than go for 3.1GHZ processor in this category or install a SSD card. Otherwise it will work Slow. Just that processor is slow otherwise it's good laptop to buy.
630,2,I am Android developer running Android studio taking lot of ram also sound problem if I run my emulator making sound not run properly waste of money don't buy it
631,1,Never buy ryzen processor it takes half of your ram like if you have 8gb you get only 6gb ram I did a big mistake please you don't do it

649,5,"The only major issue is battery backup ,which can be seen in all the gaming laptops . But once you connect it to a charger then you will get the real beast out of it . Considering the price, the laptop delivers great performance and quality of the product is very good. Total graphical memory is 5 gb ( 4gb From Nvidia+1 gb from RAM ). I'll recommend you all to upgrade your pc with an ssd of 250gb and a ram of atleast 4gb"
650,1,Its a average laptop to buy at this price point. Everything is average except for the ram it uses. I don't know why but out of the 8gbram is only 5gb is useable. This seriously slows down the laptop. Can't change the settings through bios because it is locked by HP  Do check the physical condition of the laptop. The first one i got had a problem with the F6 key.it came out of the keyboard.
651,1,Worst... product....super slow...don't waste money
652,1,"On Flipkart page it was written 0% intrest EMI from Kotak Bank. But both cheated as Bank started charging intrest. And on complaining to both, no solution was done. They just tossed the ball in other party's area to resolve the problem. Atlast I made prepayment of that emi to save the intrest amount"
653,3,Am graphic designer. After using 1 month of photoshop. Lot of hang issues. So any one buy for designing purpose. Go for Ssd version. Not this. But apart from designing. It's really good.. üòá‚úåÔ∏è. Im telling only for designing people's. Not everyone.

656,1,less Battery backup and after 15 days from date of purchase charger stop working
657,1,The Hard Drive is very slow!!! It's terribly bad for a gaming laptop. I won't suggest buying this product. It just lags a lot!
658,1,"Fan would make lots of noise, just after 20 odd days of delivery. And there's no support from the HP as well as flipkart team. You won't be able to work on laptop because of noise, I'm trying to register a complaint about this but they're not taking care of it. Please don't buy it."
659,1,"worst laptop ever. you cant even run small games on this laptop. even restart take about 5 min. you cant even play pubg pc in the very low setting. gg hp, they said it has 8GB of ram but 2.1GB of was already occupied by unknown hardware. I should have returned this waste of plastic if know it cant even run a single game."

It's not going past the welcome screen. I tried everything but it's stuck at welcome. The laptop asked for an update and it all started from there. I installed just one game and played it less than 1 hr. I am really upset and angry"

676,5,Loving it...‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
677,1,system hangs on normal usage. forget about games. just chrome with 6-7 tabs. ram was said 8 gb but ur task manager shows max as 5.9G. I think it is taken for some other processing. note over this 2.6G taken by windows with no apps open. so u will be left with meager 2 gb for all ur application. very bad decision going with rysen and windows 10. also this is not ssd but I was expecting little faster boot time. my old i3 lap with win 7 starts faster. bad decision choosing the product
678,1,Display and Performance is awesome but battery sucks

709,4,everything is good in this price range.. just U have to add an extra 8gb ram to run smoothly.. no other choice.. extra around 2500 rs for ram... and u should know that 2gb ram already reserved for system usage.. it means even if u upgrade the ram upto 16 gb still u can use only 14gb... just mind it before buying it.. and it matters.. üòï and while charging the charger getting heated so much.. I dont know it only happens to me or others too..

The battery life is very low and the 8 GB ram, we provided by 5.8 GB on which we used and the other 2.2 GB is locked for hardware. Due to lack of ssd this laptop is slow working and boot time about 25-35 sec.  But overall this laptop is great."

Actually I purchased this laptop after reading all the review but what I observed it a very slow battery is ok only and screen gets freezes I think about 50 times with in only 20days and boot up issue. Takes about 1 to 2 minutes to start the laptop after...
765,1,DONT BUY THIS...........its very very slow Sometimes it freeze for no reason It take atleast 1 min to startup Cant even shutdown the system  NOT SATISFIED AT ALL
766,1,Booting time is too long even with min loading apps. Apps loading time is also too long. Battery drains too fast.
767,1,Worst laptop of all time. Very slow and battery was a useless and causing issue within 15 days of buying
768,5,Very slow processor
769,1,I had buy this laptop just some days before. And I'm very much regretted. The battery takes too long time to charge like 3% takes 30 minutes. And the laptop is very very slow and taking too much time to start. And if you play any game it lags very much or even in between game the laptop gets lock. Very disappointed.
770,2,Takes too long to start... High graphic games lag
771,2,cant play gta 5 smoothly with this 6gb ram a lot of lag occuring

773,1,Never buy a ryzen laptop Better go for i3 Intel it works better
774,5,4days of USAGE AND in short. This laptop can be used for multitasking(coding apps) and runs fairly smooth...boot time approx 45secs and build is amazing. But there is a sluggish and conventional old laptop feels from the start..Its is kind of slow and in the promotion of the laptop benchmark says COD WARFARE runs at ultra high but the laptop doesn't even run the game smoothly like lobby and all...Gaming experience is bad when its online. Have already updated my bios and all but its pretty bad.
775,1,"screen bleeding issue noted, i return"
776,4,Due to the hdd... it's boot time and app opening time is slow but overall it's ok for a budget gamer.... The design is awesome as a gamming laptop but the top flex is visible. Built of the top is slightly disappointing. But the overall the built quality is ok. The huge disappointing thing in this laptop is that the usable ram is only 5.4GB out of 8 gb I'm very disappointed for that.
777,2,"I wanted to write this review because there are couple of things not worth.  1 Design is awesome. 2 Sound is awesome. 3 Display is awesome. 4 Performance disappointed me, I bought the laptop two days back and it‚Äôs hanging many times.

It is running game at 1080p at 40-60 fps. No issue of lag or heating is there. After playing for half an hour fan are starting to run but they are giving very cold air so no issue of beat. Temperature of graphic card maximum goes to 55 degree during games. Battery is .out 12 hrs on simple use and 6 hours o..."
853,4,Everything is good except an SSD would make a lot of difference in performance...and secondly the processor is little slower than intel i5 8th or 9th gen. But it is good compared to other gaming laptops in battery backup.
854,5,Very good laptop must buy....it is very good for engineering students and fulfilling all requirements which we want for design purpose in this price..
855,1,Received defective product. Flipkart replaced it. After replacing again received defective product. Didn't expect this from flipkart or hp. Worst experience ever.
856,4,This laptop is very good But you have to upgrade the ram and ssd After upgrading it will become beast
857,1,"Worst laptop, battery over heating, booting problem, worst build quality üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†"
858,1,Overall good product
859,5,"Excellent for the price but the ram we get is about 6gb, which is enough for day to day tasks but not for gaming... upgrading the ram is a must. HDD is a bit slow but if you want that snapiness in windows you can add an SSD. battery life is ok-ish of about 4 hrs"
860,1,It is a worst laptop it gives only 5 minutes of gameing
861,3,Bro the speed is really very slow like its hangs for like 30sec after i close a game and booting time is 1min 10secs .... If anyone can fix this please let me know coz i had put all my 3 year savings on this laptop
862,3,Battery backup not so good. Games very slow
863,1,Don't wast your money this laptop too slow even if 8gb ram and 4gb navidia  Hp service too bad and take more time to reply  This is made in china product don't buy it and easy your money
864,1,15 days after buying one port stopped working and can't handle heavy games
865,5,I happy with hp laptop and flipkart service. Thank you flipkart
866,1,PC is not working properly
867,4,it takes too much time to boot .it takes around 1;30 minutes
868,5,Hmm somewht battry issue but performance is beast
869,5,Very good laptop at its price range Best design Battery ok No doubt you can go for it
870,1,Worst Laptop I ever purchased Don't Buy It Pls Waste of money It hangs too much
871,5,Without ssd it's very much slow buy yah it's performance worth
872,1,It's very slow when we edit videos
873,2,The product advertises that it can be upgraded upto 1TB SSD but it cannot and HP confirmed that. The laptop is also very slow. I was not at all happy with it. It‚Äôs supposed to be a gaming laptop but if it‚Äôs so slow how can one play!!! This false advertisement on the sellers part is unforgivable.
874,3,Go for ssd varient It lacks even in bluestacks
875,2,After 6 month of User It‚Äôs really slow Takes lot of time to start
876,1,"Without SSD and 8 GB memory the system is unusable.  Having put 256 GB SSD and 8 GB more memory, the system performance is very good.  Not sure why they have not made it default configuration."
877,1,Not able control fan speed manually so the laptop overheating and too many repairs for hp company
878,5,There is only 5.9 gb usable ram in this laptop...
879,4,Battery backup is very low and performance is ok ok.! You can invest 5-10k more and go gor some better option.!
880,5,Very nice product..Perfect for Heavy gaming if you upgrade ram to 16gb..but its also nice to play with 8gb ram..only negative is booting time
881,5,Everything is great. Butiful Experience. But there is one problem HD varient is slow If you want faster experience Go for SSD varient
882,1,Machine is too slow. I think the performance issue is related to hdd and windows 10. Need to wait long time for machine to become responsive else it will show 100% disk usage. Users cant change the bios settings as its locked.
883,1,"This laptop is very slow , it takes 1/2 mins to open any program and load any software, it is the slowest of all other.. I'm fed up of this. I just bought this 2 weeks ago.. üò†üò† waste of money !! This is very slow, unable to work, it doesn't open any software or programs."
884,1,Got damage battery. Charges very slow about 10% in 1 hour.
885,4,I bought the laptop for more than 3 months now if you are a gamer go for an upgrade of ssd which will make your overall performance good The speakers are stunning compare to other laptops the b&o audio took it to the next level Display is epic with the streaming 4k video which is cool 8gb ram only 6 gb usable because of the consumption of integrated graphics card While gaming with hdd face lag issues for nfs payback bit after a bit its okay After a month i face a little bit of crashing issue...
886,3,Battry backup is very poor ... And please do not order this product ...without ssd it has very slow processor...
887,1,Very very slow performance üòè. Processor very slow I'm not satisfied
888,5,The Laptop if you can get it around 48 with the SBI or HDFC cards offer then it's a really great deal. The HDDs a bit slow but that's nothing an SSD won't fix and an additional 8 gigs of Ram would make any other entry level gaming laptop run for its money. Bottomline with another 7k investment this will beat anything else below 60-65k
889,1,This is the worst laptop.....works very slow...i m not satisfied...it takes 5 min to boot...
890,5,Simply superb üòçüòä
891,1,"Don't buy this product, laptop is very slow as compre to other and it's keyboard and touchpad is also don't work properly other many software problem"
892,2,Be ready to spend atleast 5k extra on this laptop for ssd .Out of the box this is a very poorly performing laptop the reason is the HDD. Definitely need a SSD. After getting ssd now I could run the games with discord open before I could not . Now I could alt+ tab within sec before it would crash. If possible upgrade ram to 8Gb 3300Mhz then this lap is a beast at the prize
893,2,Laptop is a beast but very poor battery don't expect for a long time gaming should use while charging battery drains within 1hr for gaming and 2hrs of normal usage
894,1,Very Very Very bad performance. It is very slow you can not play any game and not even use Adobe softwares for working purpose. If you want to buy go with intel processor AMD processor is useless. I am so frustrated with this laptop. Dont waste your money
895,5,Best in all way....
896,5,It's more than you expect. Played Far cry all versions . Runs smoothly . Display is good . Ram management is awesome.  But only thing you need to add 8gigs of ram more. And offcourse SSD rocks.  Install atleast 512 gb SSD and you r good to go.  Ho provides good customer care support also. But didn't need to connect with them because since 1 year it's great.
897,2,Mouse cursor not show and not working when try to installing windows 10
898,5,"Bought this on 2020. Almost 2 years of usage, super performance for its price."
899,5,Very good
900,5,Superb system but sometimes feels lag.
901,1,Cpu speed stuck at 0.4GHz during charging. After disconnet charger cpu works fine. No solution found. Try everything. Sugest something.
902,1,Extremely unhappy with the processing speed and working of the laptop.plz dont buy.
903,2,Very slow.
904,2,"Don't buy, its an slow laptop. Hhd is vary slow, if you want speed then you have to upgrade with ssd. Also of you work on multiple applications at one time then laptop may crash. Body is plastic so you have to take care of it. Other all is good"
905,1,Please don't buy... waste of money...
906,1,Don't buy this laptop Go through dell or Lenovo
907,1,Worst product
908,5,Great
909,3,"Before making a review I just want to say that... I HAVE USED THE LAPTOP...IT'S BEEN A YEAR....SO IT MAY HELP YOU! AND THIS FOR MAKING YOU CLEAR ANY DOUBTS REGARDING THIS >If you are willing to buy a gaming laptop like this or anything ,Go for INTEL processor. >Which means Ryzen is not bad but ,the device comes with 8GB ram and 1TB HDD >Because of this processor it consists at least 2 to 2.5GB Ram space. >You may run with the remaining memory and Using HDD sometimes makes irritate..."

927,1,"Out of 8 gb ram only 5.9 gb is available and performance is not that fast, hence would advise not to buy this laptop and this laptop is too slow it takes time even to open my pc"
928,5,"Awesome budget gaming laptop, great performance and looks very cool."
929,1,After using a year I'm rating this laptop don't buy this product.this is the worst product.donot go on 5star rating.this product is worst
930,2,Very slow
931,1,UPON THE EXPIRY OF ONE YEAR DISPLAY STOPPED WORKING AND COMPANY CLAIMED THAT ITS NOT UNDER WARRENTY. VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT BEING A GAMING LAPTOP ALL THE FEATURES MENTIONED ARE TO BE CAPABLE AND DURABLE KEEPING IN MIND THAT IT IS A GAMING LAPTOP. FOR NORMAL USAGE ALSO THE SCREEN STOPPED ALL OF THE SUDDEN AND COSTS ME EXTRA.
932,5,Good
933,5,"I am writing this review after 1 year of continuous usage. Very good and nice laptop it has best in class display it also passes the the dead pixel test. Displacement astic performance I play a lot of games in this, CSGO and GTA V.  It can't run call of duty Modern warfare, as ram is only 8GB, out of that too 5.88GB is only usable.  Cons: Ram is low. Only 5.88GB I have the HDD variant, and there is no SSD. So my laptop hangs sometimes, and is slow. Go for the SSD variant  Pros: There is ..."
934,4,Nice product for this budget but get ssd model for faster response and better performance than the hdd one

938,3,"Good for gaming, but if you are a programeer as well then its worst. i m using this since a year but never feel its the worth of money ,3 times i done cloud recovery (master reset)  speed is not well even it had 8gb ram"
939,1,Very slow and worst. Pls don't buy this !! Complete waste of money
940,2,"Go for a bit better version of pavilion gaming laptop rather than this one. Only 2 months and I have already replaced a harddisk, frequent lags (too much lagging) and works a bit slow. After windows 11 update it's like potato. Had better expectations from hp. Seriously"
941,3,"Currently you can find a better laptop at this rate, Avg product, High battery usage if you do some heavy work, Name sake gaming laptop but pulls out charge so quick too Better buy a similar product with SSD which can avoid all the problems I mentioned  Strong and hard piece."
942,1,Waste of money...!! Never buy this seeing anyone's review...its bad and slow after 3 months u will regret buying this laptop
943,5,"Have been using this for few months now and am loving it. The experience, reliability, and the large screen makes it really cool!"

947,4,"Good budget gamming laptop from hp,I am happy with this laptop,"
948,5,I am using this laptop for 1 year now best value for money
949,5,So lets keep it simple fantastic product unless the vents at below it are open enough For gaming can handle everything And If u gaming try rising the laptop slightly to open up the vents which will make the performance noticeable way better multitasking will improve and the hdd kinda slow but when it also given enough breathing room will perform just well so prefer slightly rised like a cardboard roll shud do just fine Overall 10/10 its epic and the specs are just fine to stream and record...
950,5,"After 1 years review This is amazing My PC Running window 11 I can use this laptop no lag,not any issues best laptop ever I think everyone buy this laptop."
951,5,"Great product , superb result , happy with the purchase ."
952,3,"This laptop has a Nvidia 1650 graphics card but by default internal onboard graphics is preferred by laptop for games. You need to change this setting in Nvidia control center to use Nvidia for graphics and games. Major downside of this laptop is it comes with 5400 rpm hard-disk, which causes it to perform very slow. For those who got this laptop with SSD, no problem for them, but for remaining they need to buy additional SSD to get decent day to day usage performance from this Laptop. Fina..."

972,2,"Slow start , not recommended because so many problems"
973,3,It was really nice I like it
974,4,There is one important thing about this laptop that is- If you add more ram upto 16gb and Ssd then this laptop is fantabulous. Warning!: Atleast 12gb of Ram is necessary to Run best of tour games.
975,3,It takes too much time to boot up.
976,3,Ok
977,2,Gaming performance was very good since it uses the graphics card. Rest of the normal day to day performance was very bad. The pc runs very slow and lagging even when you open a browser.

979,5,Very good but take some time to booting

996,5,can we use pentab with this laptop ?
997,3,I work with android studio. But this lap can not run emulators. It a bit laggy than expected. I wont say its bad but could be better. If you are looking to do heavier tasks go for another higer ones.

1001,5,I love it
1002,4,ONE THING . The Warrenty.. Got a new one and instead of 12 months of warrenty it has only 8 months warranty left and . PC opened 4 months ago for just one day and even in your Hp site you cannot dispute the Warrenty issue because HP says it's not a Consumer product but a Business product.. No Idea what to do about this. And also system is slow and gets hanging simultaneously. Display is good. Sound is not good and loud as expected.
1003,4,It takes too much time to start
1004,5,Good
1005,4,Great design and performance. A bit slow boot time.

1014,4,It is a very good laptop. Very good in this price range. Don't have too much expectations as mentioned in some other reviews. Only problem is 5.9 gb ram ( 2.1 gb is reserved for integrated GPU.
1015,3,average
1016,4,You Must have to upgrade the laptop ram for playing high specs games like GTA V and others. BTW nyc design and performance..
1017,4,GOOD FOR GAMING AND VIDEO EDITING.. BUT RAM UPGRADE IS NECESSARY FOR REACHING ITS POTENTIAL... ALSO SSD UPGRADATION FOR FASTER BOOTING TIME AND PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT..... RYZEN 3550H ITSELF IS A GOOD BUDGET PROCESSOR FOR MEDIUM- HIGH GAMING BUT THE PROCESSOR ITSELF TAKE UP 2GB OF RAM AND THE INSTALLED APPS ALSO CONSUMES MORE THAN HALF OF THE RAM SPACE..WHICH LEFT THE USER ONLY 2-3GB OF SPACE... SO BETTER TO UPGRADE... ITS LACKS LIKE HELL IN JUST STOCK 8GB RAM. OTHER THAN THAT THIS LAPTOP IS...
1018,5,Really very good
1019,4,Nice performance but sometimes get stuck when am working on my office domain.. I don't think it's good for gaming purpose...

1028,5,nice
1029,3,"Well, the laptop could run GTA 5, with basic graphics. But, whenever I felt the game froze in the middle, I had to restart the laptop. The NFS Rivals car game ran very well, with minimal graphics. Crypto mining is not possible as the GPU only has 4 gb ram. Min you would need 6 gb for those kind of activities.  The boot time is a staggering 2 minutes 20 seconds and it's frustrating. The one I got was a replacement unit. Originally received one has defective display.  Waiting for the warranty..."

1053,4,The laptop performance is not that good... because it requires to be upgraded.it is bang for the buck but without ram upgrade to 16gb and SSD you can't play any good AAA title game even at low settings...this issue is due to 2.1gb ram occupied by Vega 8 integrated graphics and paging issue due to HDD and low ram....go for it only if you can upgrade or go for another laptop...this is not a ready to play gaming laptop...

1064,5,Super laptop at this price segment.
1065,5,"If you like to buy this product go right ahead, this is a great budget gaming laptop the two downside of this laptop is out of the 8gb ram you are getting only 6gb usable the rest is used by the system so i will recommend you to upgrade the ram with atleast 4gb or 8gb ram stick and the second downside is that the 5400rpm hdd is very slow so i will also recommend a 512gb ssd upgrade for gaming"
1066,3,The screen was not working . Chk before you take this product. Hope i get a replacement of a gud quality.
1067,5,If you want a gaming laptop.You can definitely go with this laptop.But keep a thing in mind that it has a integrated graphic card which is AMD radeon vega 8 so it allocate approx 2GB of the RAM memory so you'll get only approx 5.9GB memory for RAM so heavy games like GTA V needs atleast 8GB of ram then it uses the virtual memory that is not much fast as RAM so you will feel some framedrops if you are a gamer so you have to upgrade the RAM.And also you can't deallocate the memory from the HP b...

Adobe suite works flawlessly. 3 d modelling software works without any issues. Heating could be a issue while performing 3d rendering, suggest using a cooling pad to keep temp. In control.  On stock hdd ..boot time is more..suggest to upgrade to ssd and ram upgrade from hp service centre ..in order keep warranty intact."

1079,3,"Good product!! But you can continue use at least 3 hours, it is stuck when you switch on it while every thing is good."
1080,5,Thank you
1081,4,Speed is slow but value of money for hp laptop and I suggest go with ssd varient
1082,4,It's good device in this price range packed with a good graphic card sleek design and a pretty decent processor the only and biggest draw back lack of ssd though you can cop it with a additional sum of 5000 bucks by adding a ssd ( got with nvme m.2 ssd) and you will be left no complaint.
1083,5,good look and performence
1084,3,No SSD - makes loading new software very slow. Else good product.
1085,4,good
1086,5,Good product
1087,5,best laptop
1088,3,It is laptop with good spec but the one and only thing you have to do is to upgrade ur m2. Nmve ssd to have a good performance and bettee booting time. And with this lap we can play games in a 60p frame per second but it takes some more time to open because of the hdd in the lap. Battery backup is good as it can last over 3.5 hrs min and 5 hrs of maximum timing.and the backlit keyboard is the feature that i found very much useful and also looks great in night time. Overall its a performance g...
1089,5,Best gaming laptop in this range..... As everyone said u need a ram and ssd for best performance
1090,5,Best hp laptop under this range
1091,4,if add the additional SSD in this spec then will be seen a good performance
1092,5,Good product

1095,5,Too good
1096,5,Value for money üí∞
1097,5,"Worth the money. SSD only gives 15-20 fps, without that itself its a beast, but some few lags in some point."
1098,3,Nic laptop But it's booting time and performance is slow
1099,5,"Using for 3 days now.... So far so good. In a budgeted gaming laptop, I guess it is one of the best you will acquire if you go for it."
1100,5,Performance beast ... But needed a better battery capacity...
1101,5,Nice but not that much
1102,4,Laptop is very good but the hard disk variant is slow but once you installed a ssd in it you will the beast performance.

1107,4,"Amazing laptop in this range but very slow, upgrade to ssd"
1108,3,"Booting time is more, I am not recommending."
1109,5,"What a powerful and sturdy laptop. Build quality is very impressive. I bought the 8gb version. Can upgrade to 16gb with another slot that supports 8gb ram. Ssd can also be installed. Performance wise it's ok, as I use it for editing purposes, takes time to render even JPEGs. But I think once upgraded to its full power and windows, softwares shifted to SSD, then it will be a real solid beast. As of now am loving it very much and it's a value for money buy. One thing that I found odd is the key..."
1110,5,God
1111,4,Nice product but i feel like without ssd the performance is not satisfying.
1112,5,excellent
1113,4,Honest Review! This laptop is good for normal usage and light gaming purposes though it is very slow without an external SSD .So I would really recommend you to get a SSD and if possible upgrade the ram to 16 gb for flawless gaming.Sound quality is decent and video quality is sharp.
1114,5,This is a budget gaming beast
1115,5,Complete value for money product Very much satisfactory performance
1116,3,"The Laptop is good but since there is no SSD, the bootup time takes much more than the expected time (Approx 4-5 Mins). The company is also not providing the MS Office lifetime access (which we have to pay separately). Sometimes even the responding time is also slow. Sometimes the type c port is not working properly for transferring files and for charging. There is no global warranty for this product."
1117,2,The product wasn't expected..and also support not at all in time.
1118,5,Very good....
1119,4,"The laptop was superb. But its bppting is not too fast ot takes about 30-1 min. 3-4 days aftet buying there was a problem that i cant open setting, taskbar, windows etc. So i rebooyed it. But now its working excellent"
1120,5,Best Product
1121,4,Everything is ok but it take time to open sometime good value of your money
1122,2,Very poor quality performance...not worth it
1123,3,"I have been using this for over 4 month now. It has geniunly stood up for my needs Been doing some coding and cad drawing using solidworks  Works just fine with this graphic card.. Rendering speed is good but 1) u will need a ssd asap At this point takes around 3 minutes to start and lags for some seconds too. 2) this does not include office 3) has macafee antivirus for only 21 days  Other than that coders, designers, students. If you are on a budget go for this one. Best of luck"
1124,5,Good for normal editing and gamingüéÆ
1125,4,Ssd is the real need and 8gb ram if possible
1126,4,Good
1127,5,Love this product. My first laptop.
1128,5,Honest Review  Just one thing  Add one more 8GB ram stick and bammm. U r good to go. Every single game runs at 60fps on high setting. Even RDR 2. Best laptop. Doesn't feel need of 4600h. This is enuf.
1129,5,Great design with better performance
1130,4,Everything is good but disappointed by flipkart delivery  I was told it would be delivered by 11 am but delivered at 4 pm
1131,5,"Very good laptop for gaming, runs gta 5, fifa 19 , COD and many games smoothly, for games like cyberpunk upgrade the RAM. Upgrade RAM and get an SSD and this is a BEAST."
1132,4,Aavarage system running slow
1133,5,If you are buying this product then buy a ram card and ssd with it it'll become beast after upgrading.
1134,5,Very Well Featured Laptop
1135,5,Sorry to say this The flipkart coustomer care are not responding properly when it need Am facing the issu with charger It's sparking wile charging cable connected to laptop. Am raised a request several time to Share my issue They are rising a request for call Also schedule time but not a call or massage recived from connesernd.
1136,5,The delivery was fast and packing was good.
1137,3,Laptop is nice but the delivery of ekart is not good they damaged my laptop by applying hook on box which is very bad thing
1138,5,Amazing product start very fast without sad there is a slot for sad that you can upgrade. Design is awesome most of this violet purple you will love it. Go fot it.
1139,4,Laptop is okay . But some times it become unresponsive when I use premier pro. 2gb Ram is acquired by the CPU for iGPU. But it's value for money if you can pls upgrade ram and make partitions in HDD. It's perfect but some time it lag away.
1140,4,It's Awesome üòé.. keyboard lights is loving.... Performance..... Nothing Different from another... perfect for gaming.
1141,4,The laptop was nice and all things are good and worth.but there is issues because of HDD lagging issues. But there is a slot for SSD also. While i set the SSD it was a good experience and no more lagging. So while you buy the laptop you should add ssd in it.
1142,2,"Not value for money it is better to order another product System takes to long to open main window,after installing only 1 game (valorant) it started lagging not expected thisüòûbetter order MSI with ssd do not go for hdd laptops if you want gaming laptop"
1143,5,good
1144,5,"This laptop beast needs to be evolved. For 50k price, design, finish, core, display and graphics are great. All it needs is a 512gb m2 nvme ssd with another 8 gigs ram. One of my best buys in flipkart so far."

1149,5,Nice one for all
1150,5,"Initially i was fed up with my selection, even after adding 8GB of RAM & 1TB SSD, But once i moved the OS to SSD this becomes beast, excellent performance and awesome speed, Still battery will be a problem, but you cannot expect more that this from this budget and configration,  Worth buying..!!!"
1151,4,Really great product üî•
1152,5,Budget laptop. Overall nice..
1153,5,"Due to HDD, performance wise it's bad. Other than that it's worth for money.."
1154,4,"Reviewing after 10 months Yeah comparing wd the price the laptop is a beast. No battery problems yet, No heating or lag issues...yeah but for increasing gaming experience you definitely need to change some power options which u can easily get on YouTube. I've also made some changes in amd control panel which boots performance. What I liked the most is it's cooling system. Talking about issues...yeah sometime I get this weird lowy bell sound coming up in sleep mode or idle mode...i seriously ..."
1155,5,Worthy for Money
1156,5,Good one.
1157,3,"Games are getting lag in more scenarios. In 8 GB of RAM ,Only 5.88GB is usuable."
1158,5,Amazing laptop ..... Just you need to update all driver's and perfomance will enhance 2x .... No heating issue... If you want super fast laptop just upgrade 250 GB SSD worth 3k

1160,5,"Best laptop for mechanical design softwares , go for it"
1161,2,The laptop is very slow. Not worthy

1168,3,Booting up and opening an app is very slow
1169,5,"Good laptop at this price range. It does not hv a professional look though, build quality is good. Battery back up is ok."
1170,5,Nice laptop. Performance is very good. But only problem is the loading speed. I know it ls slow because of hdd. But it's slower than average laptop boot. For the 1st boot it took around 25 mins. Then 2nd boot took around 2 minutes. Then it takes 20 to 25 seconds for booting. Screen is quite good and design is too awesome. It looks amazing. Other reviews says its battery backup is not good. But u need to know that battery is too good. I get around 6 hrs backup with 70% brightness and backlit k...
1171,5,This laptop is gaming but you have do firstly upgrade it by ssd And it's battry backup is 2.5 hours at normal use it will be become less at time of gaming

1177,4,A very good laptop for the price. Totally worth it I am totally satisfied with the laptop. I have tried multiple games and had very little issue as I always run them on full graphic. Use medium settings for higher specifications games and keep graphic drivers updated all time for best performance. I only have one issue that is of battery life. It has very low battery life of around 3-4 hrs. All in all best laptop for gaming and heavy software
1178,5,"Best product Supeb , exllentwork,very fast"

1191,4,"The product was well packaged. However to optimize this gaming Laptop to its full potential, to play games require more than 4Gb of RAM you need to add another 8Gb of ddr4 ram. For faster performance also add at least 240Gb SSD. Slots to add RAM and SSD is available."
1192,5,"After using it for 7 days I can say it's a decent system that said money can get.  Fast and reliable.

1257,4,Good experience with hp Without ssd performance is poor
1258,4,Actually I read a lot of reviews here and it said it's too slow... Believe me it's not that slow ...You will feel its slow only if you have used a ssd variant before .. Just go for it.. And update your bios and drivers and you are good to go.. I just took off a star for delivery it was a bit slow it took 14 days to deliver the product
1259,3,Okay okay not very good the thing is the likes are great and the battery is also good the only thing which is a problem is its speed its slow and yes I dont mean slowing or a bit slow it's very slow

1282,5,Hdd is littel slow but you upgrade ssd then this laptop is beast in performance
1283,5,Good laptop for casual work and gaming
1284,5,Once it will taking lot of time for booting but it's assume look and quality when we will upgrade ram and ssd it will become a beast laptop happy to buying beautiful laptop. When I received small bending in touch pad but it working so I didn't replaced for very small bend it works nice
1285,5,It's the beast go for it
1286,4,This product is great in the price range of 49K. I would suggest to upgrade ssd and ram after purchase as it will turn this into a more powerfull machine. The only shortfall I found was the fact that bios locks the advanced settings area which limits ram of this lap to 6 or 5.8 gb and wastes the potential of 2 gb in igpu which is not needed as it has a dedicated gpu as well
1287,5,beast laptop at this price
1288,5,Definitely add a SSD to it... Otherwise the lap is too slow to boot up and run... Its a plus to add up to 1tb ssd upon the inbuilt HDD.
1289,3,This laptop is very good but other 0battery is very bad for me only one hour play game I am suggest a pc for gaming but this is good
1290,5,good
1291,5,Great after 1 week of use
1292,3,"Everything was okay except the performance is slow due to HDD, better to go for SDD version"
1293,5,Good products
1294,5,u can use it for normal use gaming and much better battery and backlit keyboard is best
1295,4,Can anyone explain what is this small white light for?
1296,4,3 day used. I purchased this product only for normal purpose and Adobe Photoshop. This is good for me
1297,3,Battery is is week and speed is also slow recommend ssd drive
1298,5,Very good product value for money
1299,3,There is a slowness because of th hard disk which can be fixed by installing a SSD. There is 5.98/8gb is only usable as the processor is apu. But it's not a problem for gaming without streaming. Edit:Gaming is too horrible with the default ram we should upgrade it to get good performance
1300,5,I am totally impressed with this product Worth for Money Under 50k best gaming laptop
1301,5,Beat product in mid-range. Beast of mid-range. If your budget is 50000 i prefer you to buy this laptop. It's a beast.
1302,4,Overall pretty good gaming experience but poor battery
1303,5,Genuinely good product after 1 week of use. Using mainly for programming will start gaming and review later. So far good laptop. I love this gadget.
1304,4,It is good... Boot tym is slow... But it could be solved by increasing the ram....
1305,5,Good Product
1306,5,Looks premium but gets oil marks everywhere. Ssd is a must if you want fast loading speed. Upgrade ram also if you do multitasking of heavy apps. Ram frequency 1600mhz
1307,4,Very very good.... I am completely satified
1308,5,I bought this for mobile game development and coding and unteal engine and other apps work smoothly on this . Also gta v runs perfectly. No need to add ssd but yes ram can be upgraded to 16 gb to even more enhance the laptop but without it also it works fantastic.
1309,3,I can play free fire with lag
1310,5,Awesome product
1311,4,"When I bought this loptop earlier I thought why it performs very slow like opening applications, loading, taking more time to boot up later, I realised and I added SSD to this after that it will performing like a beast and now it is booting in 15 seconds. I am playing forntine, Apex legends, Minecraft, valorant etc., I didn't get any issues like lagging while playing the games even in 8 gb ram. In future I will upgrade ram to 16 gb but now this was enough to me. Coming to laptop Display quali..."

1319,5,All rights but boot is very slow
1320,5,It was really a nice product
1321,2,Some game like frozen 4 is not run nice till now bad is that the 8gb Ram is mentioned but 2gb is already use By system we get only 5.88gb Ram usable gaming experience is not good not bad also some game run smoothly but some are not

1324,4,Entry level laptop
1325,4,Nice one. Increase ram for better productivity. That's it. People say go for SSD. But it isn't compulsory. HDD works fine as well.
1326,4,Best in value for money...as it's HDD so performance is quite slow
1327,5,Good performance...
1328,5,It is best under prize range
1329,5,Excellent product delivered only with in 2 days
1330,5,"I would say this laptop is value for money, a great machine from HP. Since there is no SSD pre installed, I would say, it would be great if the user installs an SSD after purchasing this device. I have installed an SSD onto the machine and now most of the games I'm getting more FPS and more enjoyable."

Although there were many powerful windows laptops, beefed up with specs in this category, I wanted one which could last for quite sometime and have decent battery life.

Being a PC user for the last 10 years, I was still going over whet..."

1463,5,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
1464,5,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor. also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :) and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review... thanks for making such good product, apple."

With each update the functionality becomes better. i will divide this mac in between pros and cons. PROS: 1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously. 2) Can edit videos...
1468,5,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific
1469,5,I am very happy with the product and the Flipkart services...guys don't go for other laptops in this budget....it's very smooth portable and good graphics too.....it's very good laptop for average users acc to me more than that...brand name also matters....the people who says dsplay is terrible I want to say to those guys that display is not bad ...it's very good ...the only drawback is viewing angle other wise 10 out 10 for dis laptop.

For video editing for many layers and clips not suitable (suitable for inroom simple videos)"
1554,1,Honestly speaking . It's a very good laptop . Even in 2020 it's worth it. Battery life and sound quality is very awesome. Performance level too good . If your requirement is for professional or education use then must buy. If your requirement is for gaming then must be avoided.

It's been 7 months i have been using it, it never hanged till date and performance is great as compare to windows .

1564,5,Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.
1565,5,"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ."

The Macbook Air is good and premium.The most youtube review says its display and viewing angles are bad but its not true.its having decent display look good,if you are moving from Windows to Mac using 30-40k windows laptop then you cant have any single complain.Besides the storage you can use an external Hard Drive for storing moving and extra stuff for normal storing purpose its great with required software in it. I so happy to get this device."

Very smooth and is really good for web browsing, watching movies, light video and photo editing- that means you can edit vlogs easily in HD quality. Happy with the battery backup lasts close to 5-6 Hrs depending on the usage. Really happy that I didn‚Äôt buy windows at the same price!  Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!"
1573,5,"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money."

Best part is TouchPad, smooth operating system which makes it different. People will say I'm using macbook so I'm telling all good about it but i sah try and see ur self. It's very nice to have a basic light weight and pretty good laptop."
1582,5,it's just a nice product
1583,5,This is my 2nd Macbook air. The best part about this laptop is you can also use windows operating system with this.

1589,1,quality is not good. keypad is not as apple is known for. as i think you will find better option in this price. I will not recommend for this product. total wastage of money. only those who have extra money they buy and give good review but if you really care for money never go for this product. Performance is not good after using a week. sound quality is average color is average most bad thing is its keypad. as i am using mackbook pro there is a lot difference in keypad. just buy if you ...
1590,5,I have been an apple fan for the last 20 years and continue to be one.  The MAC Air has been a long cherished need for my work and it fits in well. The form factor and functionality is enviable.  With the numerous apps that are available. It is indispensable as a working tool.
1591,5,"I had planned to buy this during the Big Billion Day Sale. With special discount on cards etc. i got a great deal. Now if one can compare it with any other windows laptops from good brands, this is cheaper or almost equivalent. But user experience from this product is butter smooth. Have been using since Oct '2018. No complaint. I have switched, in fact, from windows to Mac OS and found why people prefer Mac. And, thanks to Flipkart for making the product affordable."
1592,5,without a doubt I trust Flipkart. such a wonderful product received in perfect packing. @ just 49990 on big billion day. No one can beat this price. In Apple store it was available for 69500. Thank you Flipkart.

1603,5,"Earlier I was a windows user and used a Dell Inspiron for almost 8 years. As I passed out of college, now my requirement from my laptop changed. I wanted a laptop which is rigid, descent looking, compact in size and most important the battery backup. MacBook Air proved itself in every aspect I wanted. I am really happy with the product and I will recommend this product for all the professionals. I got this laptop for 52k with my old laptop exchanged."
1604,5,"I am a B.Tech CS student. I am using it. It's just awesome. it's so light weight that you can carry it anywhere. the battery is so oooo good. Also it opens matlab and Pucharm in just 7 sec and 5 sec respectively, which is mind blowing . The storage which you get it out of the box is 98 gb, which is not actually sufficient but you can manage easily if you are a professional user., and doesn't like useless things in your pc.

1625,5,"I've wanted a MacBook for a while now because of the build quality and the simplicity of the OS. I spend an average 6 hours a day using it for college and the battery still has a fair charge left. The screen looks great. Apple does a great job of integrating their products.

1652,5,"Pros-: Super smooth. Awesome performance and much better experience than any high end windows PC. I am running cloudera Hadoop without any issues. Battery lasts for at least 10-12 hours. Web cam is average.  Cons-:  Only down side is display which is ideal for web surfing or coding but difference arises when you watch movies or videos.  Highly recommend for working professionals, coders, internet surfing etc. But not for gamers or watching movies."

1655,5,"Honest review. Well, the name is enough ofcourse. Works pretty fine as long as you work normally. Laga at times opening large files. For the first 6months the battery backup was like 10-11hours but now its like 5-6 hours max. Heats up like a burner if you work while charging. Got this for 44500 , yeah okay its so so."
1656,5,"No doubt, an excellent laptop. if your preference is portability and long battery life, I think this is the best you can ever find. I am comfortably getting more than 12 hours continuous-usage battery back up. Also the charging is very fast. It hardly takes 1.5 hours for full charging from less than 10% to 100%. I need not specifically say anything else, since Apple is always known for making elegant products."

1668,4,"I would be just unbiased and honest here. This is an Apple product, so definitely it's accessories and Softwares which you'd buy are also gonna be a bit on the higher side of the scale. With 13.3 Inch of size, LCD screen (which is far better than those yesteryear LCDs), this is a hefty pricing product.

1760,5,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this laptop as my first laptop with my first earnings. I didn't want regretful purchase. Although there were many powerful windows laptops, beefed up with specs in this category, I wanted one which could last for quite sometime and have decent battery life.  And since, it's a 'laptop' we should be able to use it on a lap and take it along while traveling with ease. These were my requirements. Being a PC user for the last 10 years, I was still going over whet..."

1763,5,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
1764,5,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor. also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :) and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review... thanks for making such good product, apple."
1765,5,"I bought this laptop after wondering if it's justified enough for me to purchase a MacBook Pro 13"" in India which costed nearly 122k with just 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, now having purchased a base config MacBook Air, I am very happy, mainly because I was able to buy it for under 45k by exchanging my older Lenovo laptop which was giving me a severe headache.

1767,5,I used to actually for 1 year and after that i am writing this review... I bought it in sept 2019 BBD for 49000/- Rs on sale and for me it is like a very good product.. I will suggest you to actually buy a back cover with the mac as well as it will help you to protect your mac much better. With each update the functionality becomes better. i will divide this mac in between pros and cons. PROS: 1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously. 2) Can edit videos...
1768,5,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific
1769,5,I am very happy with the product and the Flipkart services...guys don't go for other laptops in this budget....it's very smooth portable and good graphics too.....it's very good laptop for average users acc to me more than that...brand name also matters....the people who says dsplay is terrible I want to say to those guys that display is not bad ...it's very good ...the only drawback is viewing angle other wise 10 out 10 for dis laptop.

The desig. js flawless ; it's lightweight , slim, gives a premium look , the touchpad design is also very simple , elegant and sophisticated . the issue which is troubling me now is the heating issue and the battery backup.

Else the design and performance is ..."
1813,5,"I was confused between this and MacBook pro. If you ain‚Äôt going to use it as a professional 4k video/photo editor or a hard core gamer go for MacBook Pro.

1816,5,"I bought this one for stability. This one is sleek, like super sleek and sexy. Although I miss the numeric keyboard but the stability, battery and performance makes up for it. And for those concerned about quality of screen, I will say it is far better than what reviewers here say. I mean I have worked on 15k laptop, a FHD laptop (my last one) and many others one. Even though pixel wise the display is a tad lower than FHD screen but nowhere bad like those windows HD screen. I love it. Other t..."

1822,5,"I have used all company laptops, dell, Sony vaio, hp, Lenovo etc . This is the best. Great quality and smooth buttery performance. Don‚Äôt go by the specs.

But once you learn it - you will be enjoying a fantastic experience."

1836,5,"very good product (light weight, high battery back up, reliable mac os, fast speed due to SSD and 8GB RAM, and doesn't heat up when used for long, and going by history of the product it should sustain all these good points even after years, unlike other laptops that deteriorate after few months or couple of years) and then unbeatable price as I bought it at final price of 48.5k"

1839,5,Definitely one of the better laptops I have purchased. I have been using windows since the beginning and by beginning I mean windows 98 version. But am amazed by the ease of use of Mac os X. Contrary to the popular belief it's easy to use and surely very stable. The macbook air is very sleek and sturdy. It's been made to last. An enjoying working on it and will recommend it my friends.
1840,5,"Got it for 50.5K. Delivered in 4 days. Last BBD it was an ipad and this time it is a macbook air. Flipkart deserves all the commendation. About the product, silence is the best way to review this product. You have to see it and feel it to believe it. If it is your first apple product, you will just caress it for some days. If you have been a budget laptop user like me, the screen is infact an upgrade. There was hardly any better quality screen available in laptops if you have a 2-3 year old w..."
1841,5,"Firstly Delivery was superfast. Product was properly packed And sealed. Its an apple product, you buy it because u are used to premium and hassle free interface. I previously had a macbook pro 2012 model was quite satisfied with it. But it had hdd drive, so the processing got little slow over time and it couldn‚Äôt keep up with the regular software updates and it started lagging.

1844,4,"A very good mac, low end but works well for lighter tasks. I myself code a bit, watch movies, browse, and edit photos with a breeze. You could push it to its extremes by doing video editing too. Overall most satisfying. A very good lappy at the budget. I am a CSE student so I did a bit of research before buying a lappy and decided on this one. If you have more budget then you can go for the new mac(2018 the one with Retina display and smaller bezels) which is totally awesome"
1845,5,Mac OS is smooth and easy to use.... absolutely best buy for 2019 too....go for it with out a second thought.... don't get into too much research on screen pixel etc etc....for a normal user it's THE BEST laptop....not for gamers for sure....
1846,5,Beautiful Machine with great speed and nice battery back up ! Absolutely no hang ..nothing .Finally it's apple !! One drawback what I would like to mention is storage ..it would have been 256Gb . Rest is absolutely fine . Recommend to buy it !

1848,5,"Ultimate Product and Complete Peace of Mind !!  I bought Mac Book Air 6 months ago during great India shopping day, stunning slim look and lowest weight. Best part is longest battery back up of 8-9 hrs."
1849,4,"One word Worthy MacBook boot time and apps launches pretty quickly because of SSD. Processor is quite fast and keyboard haptic feedback is great, backlit light bleed is very less. Battery performance top notch. One thing that this laptop lack is screen quality and resolution.. But you always have port to connect it in BIG screen."
1850,5,"Got it for 42k after exchange offer during the diwali sale. Got an August 2017 manufactured model, checked the serial number in Apple site and sure enough it had 1 year warranty. Packing was good and laptop was protected well.  It came with Mac os Sierra out of the box and there's a free upgrade to the latest os High Sierra. Performance is silky smooth but there's a steep learning curve if you're coming from windows. Although it's thin theres a reassuring weight to the machine. Better to get ..."
1851,5,One of the finest product I have ever used in my life. Apple had really done very good job by manufacturing such a product within reach of a middle family income. Commendable job.

1853,4,"Hello,  Here is my Review after 10 days of purchase  Pro : 1.Smoothness 2.Superb battery backup 3. No hang, no lagging 4. After sell support from apple just wow 5. smooth for photoshop  Cons: 1. Charger problem, Overheated (May be in my case Only) 2. For video editing for many layers and clips not suitable (suitable for inroom simple videos)"
1854,1,Honestly speaking . It's a very good laptop . Even in 2020 it's worth it. Battery life and sound quality is very awesome. Performance level too good . If your requirement is for professional or education use then must buy. If your requirement is for gaming then must be avoided.
1855,5,"It is my first time when i was working on Macintosh and i am really impressed. It's been 7 months i have been using it, it never hanged till date and performance is great as compare to windows . For windows user who are facing issues with chrome, they will definitely go in love with this laptop. Battery backup is also good, it gives around 8-9 hrs of backup, if you are continuously working on it. Overall it's a good package, just go for it ."
1856,5,"I was little bit hesitant while buying it but since my wife loves Apple a lot, so it was the best gift option for me on her birthday. she was awfully struck with surprise while unboxing the pack.I have happily migrated from Windows to Mac now, its robust, stylish and exorbitant speed. perfect purchase.

1859,5,"After using Windows for more than a decade, I started using iPad. Impressed by the user friendliness of iPad I bought macbook air.  Pros: Very light, Long battery life (about one day of use), User friendly, very stable system (does not hang or crash), very good sound and picture quality, good metallic built, the experience of the mac ecosystem (iPad+macbook+iPod) is simply mind blowing (specially the air drop feature).

1863,4,"Good laptop. For people who have normal use like for office. This is perfect. However, battery could have improved more. Charger cable get torn after few months, would recommend people to buy spiral band to avoid any wear and tear in cable."
1864,5,Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.
1865,5,"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ."
1866,5,"Amazing product. I got it for my development and believe me it works so well with Android studio, jet brains ide. Till now no performance issues."
1867,4,"First, Flipkart is just too good at delivery! Product is perfect. Bought it in a hurry in the festive sale, as Apple raised the price of even the old model of Air by 17k. Overall. The product is good, handles office level multitasking pretty well. Though I had two instances of a slight lag for 3 seconds... (I had 25 application windows open at that Time). Typing is a breeze, adjust the keyboard setting ls to your speed, and it's great. The fluid design of the OS is known to all. Battery stan..."
1868,2,"Display sucks, battery life is great, portable enough so don't think of weight, battery life good enough you don't have to carry n charger everytime"
1869,5,"The product is insane. Superb speed and finesse both in terms of looks and in terms of performance. For people who fear they worked kn windows their entire life and now mac might be difficult, go buy it man.. nothing like that..you can learn it in a day..its amazing.. worth buying at this amazing price.."
1870,5,"So much Happy.. The Macbook Air is good and premium.The most youtube review says its display and viewing angles are bad but its not true.its having decent display look good,if you are moving from Windows to Mac using 30-40k windows laptop then you cant have any single complain.Besides the storage you can use an external Hard Drive for storing moving and extra stuff for normal storing purpose its great with required software in it. I so happy to get this device."
1871,5,"It's an Apple product so rest assured your not going to be disappointed even the slightest, great battery life, nice display, smooth Mac OS, can do casual gaming, top notch creativity machine. Fast delivery by Flipkart and great customer support. Money spent well"
1872,5,"It was very well packaged and delivered on time. Works like a dream, boots in seconds, even faster than some phones! Very smooth and is really good for web browsing, watching movies, light video and photo editing- that means you can edit vlogs easily in HD quality. Happy with the battery backup lasts close to 5-6 Hrs depending on the usage. Really happy that I didn‚Äôt buy windows at the same price!  Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!"
1873,5,"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money."
1874,5,"My Review after one month of usage. I would like to say Awesome product, Awesome Service, Awesome Delivery. Thank you Flipkart, Apple and Ekart Logistics as well."
1875,5,"It's awesome. I was waiting to buy this from long time. Finally I bought it at very good price 43k, thanks Flipkart sale.  For 43k I got MacBook air 2017. MacOS will blow ur mind. It's worth every penny your are paying. Everyone know the pros, the only con is screen. But trust me guys display is still awesome. It gives immense pleasure to work on Mac. It's must buy unless you are a gamer."

Best part is TouchPad, smooth operating system which makes it different. People will say I'm using macbook so I'm telling all good about it but i sah try and see ur self. It's very nice to have a basic light weight and pretty good laptop."
1882,5,it's just a nice product

1889,1,quality is not good. keypad is not as apple is known for. as i think you will find better option in this price.

Performance is not good after using a week. sound quality is average color is average most bad thing is its keypad. as i am using mackbook pro there is a lot difference in keypad. just buy if you ...
1890,5,I have been an apple fan for the last 20 years and continue to be one.  The MAC Air has been a long cherished need for my work and it fits in well. The form factor and functionality is enviable.  With the numerous apps that are available. It is indispensable as a working tool.
1891,5,"I had planned to buy this during the Big Billion Day Sale. With special discount on cards etc. i got a great deal. Now if one can compare it with any other windows laptops from good brands, this is cheaper or almost equivalent. But user experience from this product is butter smooth. Have been using since Oct '2018. No complaint. I have switched, in fact, from windows to Mac OS and found why people prefer Mac. And, thanks to Flipkart for making the product affordable."

1903,5,"Earlier I was a windows user and used a Dell Inspiron for almost 8 years. As I passed out of college, now my requirement from my laptop changed. I wanted a laptop which is rigid, descent looking, compact in size and most important the battery backup. MacBook Air proved itself in every aspect I wanted. I am really happy with the product and I will recommend this product for all the professionals. I got this laptop for 52k with my old laptop exchanged."
1904,5,"I am a B.Tech CS student. I am using it. It's just awesome. it's so light weight that you can carry it anywhere. the battery is so oooo good. Also it opens matlab and Pucharm in just 7 sec and 5 sec respectively, which is mind blowing . The storage which you get it out of the box is 98 gb, which is not actually sufficient but you can manage easily if you are a professional user., and doesn't like useless things in your pc. Believe me You will love it."

I spend an average 6 hours a day using it for college and the battery still has a fair charge left. The screen looks great. Apple does a great job of integrating their products.

1952,5,"Pros-: Super smooth. Awesome performance and much better experience than any high end windows PC. I am running cloudera Hadoop without any issues. Battery lasts for at least 10-12 hours. Web cam is average.  Cons-:  Only down side is display which is ideal for web surfing or coding but difference arises when you watch movies or videos.  Highly recommend for working professionals, coders, internet surfing etc. But not for gamers or watching movies."
1953,5,"Purchased it a month ago. So far going extremely well. Performance is mind blowing. Touch, screen quality and other aspects are good as per the apple standards. Overall worth product to buy!! - - - - Its been 2 years now and laptop is still working pretty smooth"

1955,5,"Honest review. Well, the name is enough ofcourse. Works pretty fine as long as you work normally. Laga at times opening large files. For the first 6months the battery backup was like 10-11hours but now its like 5-6 hours max. Heats up like a burner if you work while charging. Got this for 44500 , yeah okay its so so."
1956,5,"No doubt, an excellent laptop. if your preference is portability and long battery life, I think this is the best you can ever find. I am comfortably getting more than 12 hours continuous-usage battery back up. Also the charging is very fast. It hardly takes 1.5 hours for full charging from less than 10% to 100%. I need not specifically say anything else, since Apple is always known for making elegant products."

1968,4,"I would be just unbiased and honest here. This is an Apple product, so definitely it's accessories and Softwares which you'd buy are also gonna be a bit on the higher side of the scale. With 13.3 Inch of size, LCD screen (which is far better than those yesteryear LCDs), this is a hefty pricing product.

2027,5,"Fast boot time , excellent display, no slowness, definitely good."
2028,4,"It gives me nearly 7 hrs of battery life when I stream on YouTube, Viki etc. Even though it's only dual core yet I have never faced any kind of lag. Best thing is, if you want to do video editing it comes preloaded with iMovie, which in my opinion gets the job done for most of the people who edit videos."

The laptop runs really smooth. MacOs is simply the smoothest and richest operating system. If you want a laptop that 'looks' awesome, this is the best option. At a price of 55K INR, it is a steal.

2070,5,Got it at a discounted price while opting for the No Interest EMI scheme. Flipkart delivered the product very next day. Packaging was good and solid. On unboxing got a perfectly sealed MacBook Air in the box. Just love how sleek and polished the laptop is. Coming from the 2011 MacBook unibody(lasted me 7 years and still working) this is a very welcome upgrade. The specs are more than sufficient for my day to day work and business travels.
2071,5,I purchased it on last big billion day. After all the offers I just had to pay only 44.5k for this device. For me it is very good value for money deal. My main purpose is office work and just browsing and all. The device actually comes with and outdated chipset. But because of the os integration the device is blazing fast compared to my friends windows laptops with more advanced chipset. I know the main customers of this device must be buying their first mac os device. For those persons like ...

2081,5,The Macbook Air is an amazing product. It's a piece of art. Since last 20 years I have been using Windows PC so I was bit nervous if I will be able to adept to Mac.

2117,1,"The rating given is based on the experience I had. Bought this product on Big billion day Oct'19, within a week I had to take it to service center. Issues I faced was - 1. Heating. 2. Not booting and showing black screen. 3. And finally it stopped working and not able to switch it on."
2118,1,Not worth it to buy such a overly priced and overy hyped device. Its repairing costs more than the actual CP. This is horrible. Had to shed another 45000 for repairing its logic board.

I contacted flipkart customer care and got immediate response that as i am still under warrenty so I shall get free service from icare. I contacted icare and you cant believe they have replaced the charger COMPLETELY FREE OF COST!! so it is myth that online product doesnot comes with warranty."

Strongest point is it's battery... Sometimes I've got 14-15 hours of battery backup... In 60 days of usage I've just charged it 22 times (Voila!

My experience on very first day few keys are not working and I reached out to the Flipkart and they gave me response stating to visit and nearest mac service center.

2210,5,Okay it felt little harder for me to use MacBook Air as i switched from windows to macOS. The display was just too small I thought when it got delivered but after using & realised performance I Thought its not windows lol to give 15-16 inch screens
2211,5,Cool üòéüòé nice product
2212,5,I had lots of doubt about the macbook and apple products on flipkart. 1) whether i will get the original or duplicate product but after getting the product my this doubt got clear. I received the seal packed product and i verified my warranty details also on the apple website. 2) As i was switching from Windows laptop to macbook laptop. So i was worried about whether i would be able to install all the application which i was using on windows laptop. As i need laptop for the programming so n...
2213,1,"Mojave is very slow. In the flipkart link, it says Sierra, but the one I got is Mojave. Performance is not as expected. Rest all good."
2214,1,"It seemed to be a very good deal initially. It worked perfectly for few months. However, screen got damaged due to water. Apple store was asking for 44k to replace screen. Got it replaced from outside in 22k. System used to hang multiple times. Who says apple devices don't hang. They do. Finally, the worst part, charging issue. Device doesn't charge."
2215,5,Amazing product. Got for 49990 in big billion sales. Good delivery. Thanks flipkart.
2216,2,It work slow
2217,1,"This product came as defective from the inside (which common man can not see from the first eye). When it ran into error mode I visited The Apple store to fix the errors, Apple store replied to me that the product has a circuit damaged which can not come under warranty. I paid extra Rs. 7000 to fix that problem.  Terrible seller."
2218,1,"Please don't buy this product, This laptop has crashed within less than 7 months of its purchase. I would not recommend Apple Air to anyone. I gave it enough number of chances but it just doesn't deserve anything. The laptop crashed Four times and the engineer at the service center now says that the motherboard is faulty. Apple better refund my money on this piece. Macbook Charger gets excessively heat up within 10 min of first use. And Flipkart is asking me to visit apple service centre inst..."
2219,5,Buttery smooth performance and premium design! Beautifully made and also powerful at the same time! Apple's optimization of power and memory is just unmatchable! Battery lasts quite long and sleep mode doesn't consume even a percentage of battery! Definitely recommended!
2220,5,"It's blazingly fast, user friendly ( if you are a windows user then you need to spend couple of hours on first day) , slik."
2221,1,It stopped working after 15 days of purchase. It opens up and then everything becomes black and nothing is working even after pressing power button while the charger is connected. Sometimes apple logo appears and then again it went dead.
2222,4,"BBD best deal as got it in 37590 with exchange of my old laptop. Although it's old model but in terms of usability, performance, design, battery backup, sound, overall everything is excellent, decent enough for daily usage. it's a steal deal Apple MacBook Air rocks."
2223,1,The trackpad of my new MacBookAir doesn't work or respond to a click. And it's not even a day but Flipkart won't take it and instead asks me to visit Apple centre. After sales service doesn't exist here. What distress!

The laptop had increased my productivity since it forces me to do one task at a time. Display is not that good. It will keep reminding you how old this model is. Other than that, this model is good for development work."

2273,1,When I start after shutdown then mouse doesn't work and while updating OS also it failed after 99 % every time. Processing speed is too slow. They mentioned it has i5 processor but it doesn't work like that. Webcam quality is too bad.
2274,1,"While doing new update screen gone blank. Took it to service centre and they said mother board is gone and it will cost 36K from apple care support. This is nonsense and warranty period is just for 1 year after all you are spending so much amount and I got this problem exactly in 14 month from the day of purchase I missed by 2 months, my bad luck.

As it's new, for it's long lasting review we have to wait for a year. Only one issue is it's less memory i.e 128 hard disk. It's ssd that's good. If you have a portable hardrive then it's ok."
2397,5,"i think that this is one of the best product Apple has made. Thanks to Steve Jobs.  Display is good. There are many people who complain that it is not good compared to newer models but it gets all the things done without any hassle. For the rest, everything is best."

2424,5,Awesome
2425,4,Product was genuine but 1 star reduced for slow delivery. I expected 2 day delivery but Flipkart took 4 days to deliver it.
2426,5,Apple is Apple. No One one can beat it  Pros: Best battery life Negligible boot time Powerfull machine Sleek and premimum design  Cons: Less storage but that can be overcome by having external Hard disk. Not for hardcore gaming  P.S: Purchased at Rs:45k  So if your budget is less than 50k go for it!

2428,3,Getting os corrupted message frequently when turned on!! rest is good
2429,5,Positive 1.Battery back up is very good. 2.Very slim body 3.Power efficient Negative 1.xls file takes some time to open but after installing Microsoft office there is no problem. 2.You have to install application for file transfer from android phone
2430,5,"Nothing more to say. It's Apple. First trillion dollar company. I loved it. I use it daily for work, video editing, programming, and so on. The delivery was delayed due to big billion day sales. It was delivered in good condition. Although one cons is it gives shocks when connected to charger. The shock is not noticeable so it's not a dealbreaker. Other than charging time, it doesn't gives a shock."
2431,5,macbook doesn't need reviews because its the best.
2432,5,SUPERB

I got it at ‚Çπ45000 using multiple offers during big billion days, so good deal for me for it's 8 GB Ram and i5 with the need to buy almost every extra software."

2455,5,Bought in Big Billion Day...Awesome Deal.. Exuberant Product :)

2466,5,thankyou flipkart for such great deal.
2467,5,Really I like this product. Nice battery backup and totally different from windows.
2468,5,"No words to describe, loved the product."
2469,2,The flap just falls back if you open it a bit more than a right angle. Happens for all the Macs ordered through Flipkart.
2470,5,Fine refurbished design with minimal touch and the amazing blend with mac os Sierra. Although the processor is quite behind of time.
2471,5,"My MacBook Air delliverd in time on 15 May 18, with multiple offers, thanks to flipkart and retailnet for their support."
2472,5,"Works flawlessly, I mainly use it for software development üëç"
2473,5,I have been using it for about 6 mo. The battery life on this thing is amazing! Just gets the job done!
2474,5,awsm..........
2475,5,Simply Awesome
2476,5,"I am writing this review after 8 days and really mesmarized about this product. Very thin and light. If you are a windows user then most certainly you would find some difficulty in Mac OS. Other than that hardware configuration, look and feel is unbeatable within the price range with regards to other products.  Regarding delivery, delivered my product before the said date. I bought two same laptop for me and for my spouse."
2477,5,No need to tell that it is really good. Worth its price.
2478,5,Excellent packing by Flipkart.Product is so so good.I love it

2484,5,I had lot of doubts before buying it.. but I am fully satisfied with it...works like a dream...very sleek...fast and stylish go for it you won't regret
2485,5,The Laptop is too good. If you want middle range macbook you can go for it. The package from filpkart is also upto the mark. Battery backup is solid. You have to purchased Office 360 for microsoft word and excel. Also you can update new software update. Just go for it you'll not regret..    Only thing is Rom 128GB but if you have external hard disk then its not that much problem. I'm using this macbook with 1TB HDD
2486,5,"Excellent product!! Got it for 41k including discounts, exchange, cashback...price made it sweeter!! Performance wise, i just felt resolution should have been more. Rest all good."
2487,5,Undoubtedly the best laptop with the budget of under 50K go for it! It is really great!

2489,4,"Too soon to write a review about the product. It's a plain old MacBook Air. Plenty reviews available. So just writing about flipkart experience. Got a great deal during their festive sale, So that's nice. Delivery was very slow. Five days. Amazon delivers within 48 hours. Get some protective gear in time so you don't have to be extra careful handling it Update 1: A minor problem made me see the service center who the next day told me that they will have to replace the logic board because of w..."
2490,5,Who will say no to apple.. Best to carry nd good battery backup...

2495,5,Very good laptop specially battery life.Purchased for tractor pro dj software. Delivery was well before time by Flipkart
2496,5,Good packaging After 5 day of use I will say that it's a little beast that beats windows based machine in every aspect. It's rightly said. First impression is the last impression. I got it for 45k in big billion day sale. It's worth. Don't hesitate just go for it.
2497,5,It's divert before .. packing was quite good .. Manufacturing 2017 Aug i was worry about that but it's recent model ..
2498,5,Got a awesome deal with exchange....
2499,5,Amazing product - apple products dont need words.
2500,5,This is the newer version with latest 2017 Sierra OS. It comes with 8GB ram. 10 hours battery life on full charge. full aluminum body.  Go for it.
2501,5,Very good product ...great changeover for Me from Windows to Mac... way to go with Mac...
2502,5,Impressive!!!
2503,1,Damage product send so I suggest do not buy.
2504,5,Who else got it for 38K :D
2505,1,"Within two months it's stopped, I try to on but it not working"
2506,5,"Too confused to write any review. The product do not have any issues. But there is a but that I am unable to explain myself. So decision is all yours if you want go for it, if you do not want don't go for it."
2507,5,This is one of the best MacBook from Apple. Even it is performing much better than the latest version of MacBook Air.
2508,2,If you want to buy it for that Apple logo and amazing build quality it will be a great buy... the problem is actually in mac os... If you switching from windows to mac( in this case you most probably are) you are actually downgrading in terms of os.. Mac is no where close to windows... You will feel cramped you won't find lots of handy options... Dragging is such a mess... And lot of such problems... That even you get familiar with the os you are going to miss tha windows os.
2509,5,This machine is great...for everyone except gamer....you see the specs are not so good as per price but the performance is better then i7 16 gb ram Windows laptop
2510,5,product.... is good.... i bought this mac at 45k recently....i dont know the real price exactly may be 60k or 70k....so guys out there wait for proper time and bye it.... If ur confuse buying mac 17 or other laptop -gamer these mac isnt for u -storage is low.... bt it dsnt matter me much coz i use for only for study purpose jst by saving pic n documents or any study matetial....i use it for watching movie.... later i delete that movie....these is how i save my storage *if u want to known more...
2511,5,nice product.fast deliver....love it
2512,5,"Laptop is super good, there is no need for a r view. But one main thing is seller's packing. It was packed carelessly with some Buble wrap pieces here and there. Apple's boxing for the MacBook was in bad shape when delivered. A simple footwear deserves better packing"
2513,1,Ok ok don‚Äôt worth it
2514,5,If you want apple you can buy this.  If you want laptop which will be useful for coding video editing and other stuff choose other brands   Apple is selling 10 rupees product for 1000 price with apple logo.
2515,1,"Very,very disappointing. Was expecting top-notch performance but found quite a lot of issues making it a deplorable experience for me. I moved from Windows for a better experience but clearly, it was a mistake."
2516,5,"Itz have been 90 days after buying this. Such a awesome product.. No drawbacks.. High performance,No lagging,No battery issues,10 hour battery backup,no charger problem.. üîπOnly problem is charger will heat much more we can prepare Tea or Omelet with this heat üòÅ. Just with one word about this Mac is """" Beast""""."
2517,4,"go for it in 2020 or 2021...Why not...??? It is batter than windows i7 and most of i5 super fast, world class designe, super display, long battery Once you use, you love mac OS I wiil get it only 45k in BBD 10/10/2018"
2518,1,Wrong please don't place order from this side or application it's worthless.. I purchased mackbook i5 but I saw a lot scratches in display after opening... So please don't purchase any apple product from this application (Flipkart)
2519,5,nice prodect
2520,1,the battery is draining very fast even with just internet surfing
2521,1,It is not so good as I thought before buying. Speed is almost same. Only you boast of brand name. It not so user friendly. Ms office is not there.
2522,1,Good product but price varies
2523,1,I bought a macbook air 2017 and it gives reapeated shocks while switching it on... It has some serious heating issues.. And guess what.. IT GOT STUCK AND DOESNT MOVE. AND THE ARROW KEYS FOESNT WORK ANYMORE!!!
2524,2,"don't buy this Laptop, the Mac Book Air very bad quality parts, this should be repair after 10 month or 15 months, the repair cast near 43000/- , if you ready pay next 43K , you will buy , or should be buy extend warrant , if not don't buy this Mac book. I am not understand the Big Apple product is very bad."
2525,3,Great
2526,2,Pathetic product delivered by flipkart. Charger stopped working after 7 months and even the mousepad. System shuts down abnormally. No response taken by flipkart so far after sending multiple emails. Waste of money and mentally harassing.
2527,4,Amazing quality
2528,5,The product is great. I will highly recommend this to everyone who is interested.Go for it guys.It is worth every penny üòä
2529,5,Very nice products.
2530,5,Good but price high
2531,1,"I have purchase this product before 1 year 4 months ago, but now it is dead. When i go at apple repair center then they asked me around 42000Rs for fix the issue in my Macbook air, But before one year when i was purchase this at cost 64000Rs... This is wrost product that i have purchase in my life.... please do not purchase this product... This is waste of money....."
2532,5,Perfect
2533,5,Awesome product Thanks Flipkart Delivered also in Lockdown period .
2534,4,I have bought this for 51K. best price and best choice.
2535,5,"Not as good as other model of mac book air, motherboard get crash in just 4month."
2536,5,As seen and shown in product image display exactly same product arrived. Highly recommended to put a screen guard along with the skin cover for any further scratch on the body of the product Otherwise too good product to use.
2537,5,"product is awesome as it is Apple products , but taking from. Flipkart is not good"
2538,5,"Awesome price, Awesome product, Value for money. Flipcart delivered BEFORE time. Thanks a ton."
2539,5,Hi Team Battry Bacup not giving
2540,1,charget not found
2541,4,All are good but large excel files are not open in number application. Need to download MS office for work . Only this the main problem otherwise its a mind blowing product
2542,5,"Awesome product, I bought this laptop on Big billion days, I got for 50k, wherein there was extra 10% off on only HDFC card which I didn't possess, so have to bear the pain of paying extra 5k.  product is worth of paying so much and also performance is good, if your thinking to buy personal laptop for atleast 2 - 3 years without any hassle then this is the right product."
2543,2,I think window is better system Crashes
2544,4,product is good and is performing well with latest OS Packing was very good and delivered safe..
2545,5,Very nice product apple MacBook air
2546,5,Superb product
2547,2,Nice but build quality of macbook air is not as robust as before. Backplate knocks when u hold it in hands. It knocks continuously when u use it in bed or Diwan cot. Absolutuley annoying for this half lakh worth product.
2548,3,"Pros Delivery on time. Awesome laptop in terms of speed, performance, battery back is just superlative..runs thru the day on a single charge even a mobile phone battery doesnt last as long in most cases.  Cons But the laptop screen hinge is loose, on minor movement of the laptop the screen flips back. one of the usb port has some issue, two clips/strips of metals in it are not in line with the slot and therefore difficult to insert pen drive/hdd."
2549,5,The macmachine is awesome but the delivery by Ekart logistic was pathetic.The delivery guy named Ramakant was rude that can not be expressed.Only in Indian companies this kind of employees can be seen.Foreign companies will not hire such kind of staff who will destroy the fame and image of the brand towards the customer.
2550,4,1 star cut for non availability of CD player in MacBook otherwise awsum
2551,5,My love..... Simply awesome performance new macbook air 2017
2552,5,Small and elegant laptop that can carry anywhere you want. Powerful machine. Awesome design
2553,5,Amazing machine. Absolutely love using the MacBook.Great battery backup.Very advanced engineering is involved in this machine.Just go for it.
2554,5,Stunningly superb
2555,1,I buy this one here on flipkart on oct 17 th i have warntry i didnt use much also but the apptronix guy is saying that it is liquid damage warrantry wont cover wrost product ever dont buy any apple products on online
2556,1,MAC is not for India because most of supporting app and software are not working with mac operating system. Therefore apple should bring laptop with window Microsoft or substitute of Mac so that we can use. otherwise it is only box. Another point I want to add that b2 b GST invoice is not issuing to customer. Although they are charging GST. not issuing of B2B GST invoice is red alert...??
2557,1,bettery performance not upto the mark
2558,4,It's a good product but not value for money
2559,3,Still using it almost like 1 year  Battery is best in the work   Rayanmotovlog summer vlog YouTube
2560,5,It's performance is so consistent and optimised.. it is almost unbelievable.. it performs better than my pc with i5 10th gen
2561,4,"Happy with product, but have issues on battery backup... Soon I will visit apple store... But I think flipkart member can look this matter seriously.. For future improvements"
2562,5,"the best option for the ones looking to buy a machine with a good battery backup and do editing and stuff. It's overall good for everything, if it's a movie or music, it will fit well. Yes, you can't play games, its a mac. other than that, it wont disappoint you."
2563,1,Battery backup is 3~4 hrs and this was not accepted by apple. No return option from flipkart.
2564,1,not good quality
2565,5,awesome product saves lot of time
2566,1,Product is not user friendly no lan port at all. More over the return scheme from Flipkart not allow you to return if u r not satisfied.
2567,1,In 10 days my os freezes and crashes this is very very very bad experience.this problem is solve by apple customer service but my important data is lost mahine is very good but update all app and system is necessary
2568,3,"1.Performance is awesome 2.battery back is just 4-5 hrs..if u r playing games, battery drains fast..limited gaming support.. 3.good for professional and basic uses.. 4.display, sound quality is good.. 5.overall product is good except battery backup as mentioned in product description 10-12hrs I did not get till now. 6.it gets heated sometimes when using android studio emulators and when multiple chrome tabs(more than 10 tabs) are opened"

I bought apple products in USA too and never faced any quality or service issue. Se...

I truly regret buying it from here. Flipkart sells defective products. This one was a replacement, still it didn't work.  I will never recommend flipkart to anyone."

2616,5,"I had purchased it in Nov. 2020 a& today is 7 June 2021. Major points for the exellent performance :) Pt. 1 -> Make sure you are in a cool room while using the mac because it comes with the thermal cooling. Pt. 2 -> try not to upgrade you software to Big sur if it comes with Catilina. As you will face Battery drain issue sometimes. Pt. 3 -> You can continuously use your mac upto 6-7 hours. (Browsing, Movie, Youtube,Netflix etc.)"

2630,5,"Excellent product by mean of design, power, efficiency. I am not a big supporter of the Apple products since it's service model. But, this product is very precise in every manner (convince, battery backup, processor speed, look, adepter). Only one thing i.e. storage space is little bit small. Rest is fine. At this price ( 58000 Rs) this product is nice."

2660,5,Just Amazing
2661,5,Good
2662,5,Loved the product. Everything is cool about this laptop. I got macbook air with laminating apple logo design at the back of display. I liked it
2663,4,Though it's an old version but working well. Switching from Window to Mac was completely new experience but loved it. My daughter is enjoying her online class from mobile to Mac... Camera and sophisticated charger still a concern but overall deserve ****
2664,3,ROM is less due to which it run slow.
2665,5,This is the last macbook that you can buy which can be repaired by outside technician. I got my old one repaired 3 times. The newer macbooks are literally unrepairable by third parties. So if you are buying a macbook and do not want to spend extra with apple guys. go for this one.

2731,5,The product is no doubt superb but the exchange policy of Flipkart is worst. I had a very bad experience this time. Even I plan to cancel the order. The wish master or the guy who come for exchange is only giving 2000/- of my old laptop where as I am expecting 8500/- for the exchange value. The guy later confirm that we never give customer to there desired value. Finally I end up with cash value for the order and plan to sell my old laptop myself

2826,5,"A macbook at this price is a steal but it's not useful for anything other than light browsing, working on ms office (will have to spend extra on that) and other light applications. This is a 2017 model with an older gen processor. It might get Big Sur but any update beyond that is a question mark. Also the display tech is very old. However, The build quality and light weightedness is better than even double priced windows ones. If you are light user and and a new/old apple convert then go for..."

2850,5,"Read it carefully!  Before going to buy a Laptop full with new specifications, just remember one thing; ""Apple sabka baap hai"". My Macbook Air was manufactued on September, 2020 and the best part is it comes with Mac OS Catalina. I upgraded it to Mac OS Big Sur. Believe me, there is even no lag while even importing or exporting videos in iMovies (jo nhi jante ho, yea KineMaster ka baap hai, apple ka apna in-built app).

2879,4,I had recently purchase this Macbook Air 2017 model on 21st October. I was concerned by reading online reviews about this seller TrueComRetail.  I received the product on 28th october.

2889,4,Purchased during Flipkart Big Billion Days 2020. No doubt mac is always a best choice as far as it's performance is concerned. Found only 2 cons. 1. Battery is giving hardly 6 hrs backup. I was expecting minimum 8 hrs backup with my limitation usage as browsing and YouTube. 2. Adapter gets heated very high whenever I charged in 1 shot from 10% to 90% .  Rest everything is Good.

2915,4,"There is absolutely no comparison between MAC & Windows. This is the best operating system in terms of performance, durability & battery backup which is very well complemented by it's asthetics.  Packaging is top notch (as expected)  What is astonishing for me is the delivery time and below average customer service. This is indeed an area worth looking at. Hope Flipkart take necessary actions to ensure product should reach within the date of commitment."

2917,5,Good perched
2918,5,One if the best purchase
2919,5,Excellent!I'm a windows laptop user.wanted something sturdy.bought this.does the job well.one needs to buy office365 separately!comes with OS catalina. I'm not sure if 128 GB would be enough for everyone so an additional storage expense should be kept in mind.battery back up is good.
2920,2,After 6 months of use the laptop gets overheated so much and lags also.Also tally doesn't work in this.The battery in the start is so amazimg but after 6 months of use it drains like heavy rain.
2921,1,Quality of display is worst.... No clarity of pic... It look like old time smartphones display

2925,5,I got a recent and Aug manufactured Macbook and not from old stock. Only problem I can see in 15 days usage is that the power adapter/brick is getting very hot while charging despite it being the new MagSafe 45W power adapter. I raised the issue with Apple Care but yet to get any satisfactory resolution.
2926,5,Awesome.... Product..... Surely go for it... Who said that Apple is not good.it's awesome... Love it.. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
2927,5,"It's Lovely ,I purchased for my brother and he is extremely happy with that book.big billion day is really helpful for middle class buyer.."
2928,5,Fabulous
2929,5,Good quality
2930,5,Nice product from Apple very nice coding and very good for students
2931,5,Awesome lappy as expected
2932,1,"It's dead less than 2 years later despite very basis usage. Even the apple support centre isn't able to fix it despite charging 35k. Would recommend not buying. If you do, pls add on the extra insurance."
2933,5,This is so awesome üòä
2934,5,Buyed it during Big Billion Days. Performance is awesome and boot up very quickly. Battery last for something like 11 hours with wifi on and surfing at medium Brightness. Display should have been better. But Sound quality is just superb.
2935,5,Excellent Dilelivery from Flipkart and Apple No dought on product...
2936,5,Great product
2937,5,Great Machine!
2938,5,Perfect
2939,1,Worst experience product is not working after 1.5yrs . Unnecessary waste of money.
2940,5,Battery was awesome.. Performance management was really good. Note* Not for gamers.. Rest go blindly...
2941,5,Good laptop. I got it for 56k worth it. Display is not great. You can buy lifetime subscription of office at 2000 for those who are worried about office.
2942,1,I have purchased the product but the screen gets off in between automatically and also when i touch the screen it gives electric shock sometimes
2943,5,Awesome
2944,5,I received this macbook air yesterday. This review based on first day use of macbook air: Pros: Battery I think 8 hours to 10 hours working once fully charged 2)Very Fast charging 3) Apple customer support is good 4) Proceeser Fast working 5) Light weight 6) Sound is good Cons: 1) Display is average Suggestions: Very good os
2945,5,If u are comparing it with windows by looking at its specs just don't ...if u are getting it below 60k just go for it.and the display it is not bad at allll....battery is great...performance is great but no gaming on this machine*****video edting is smooth like very very smooth except 4k it does the job thoough...
2946,5,Except display everything is grt
2947,5,Awesome laptop

2961,5,Very good product value for money tough build quality and also give smoother performance
2962,3,This apple macbook air nice in design. One cons is heating issue in bottom. During charging i was seeing online movie then bottom of laptop & charger is being more heated than as usual. This must not happen with premium company's laptop.
2963,5,Mind blowing super.
2964,5,Good product

2983,5,Very good for coding
2984,5,The packaging n product quality is awsone. Will revert on its functioning in due course
2985,5,"I was sceptical about buying a macbook first, but I never regretted buying one. If you are in a dilemma whether to go do this or another option. Just go for this."
2986,5,Light as a notebook. Great battery life. Superb performance.
2987,5,Wonderful product by apple sure to sugest other
2988,5,I brought it to study reactjs and do some web development it‚Äôs working good as of now
2989,5,Good quality
2990,5,Well do little research before u buy this laptop..as per ur usage. Till date the specs seems like lil outdated but the performance is like awsm. If you have little budget extended dn I would suggest to go with Mac air 2020. Still it is a value for money deal.
2991,5,Delivery before time with good packing. Product works fine. Got the best deal during big billion sale.
2992,5,Nice product
2993,4,Very very bad display looks are excellent performance is excellent battery life and so too good but this place I have ever seen in this price range
2994,5,One word only! Superb...
2995,4,Very very old model MacBook
2996,5,Super as thin as air
2997,4,"The product was amazing, The outer box was damaged severely, But the laptop box inside survived. The delivery guy is bad, He told to come to logistics store for pickup, He didn't come for delivery. . . The product was amazing. Worth for 60k, . . For a product worth 60k a customer will expect faster delivery and good packing, But Flipkart failed in both, It took a week to deliver it and the outer box was severely damaged. . . Flipkart is worst, If you want this laptop, better buy in some other..."
2998,5,What a product. Macbook air is amazing. If you thinking to shift from windows to mac I am damn sure that you are not going to regret..
2999,5,Loveliest Mac‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
3000,5,I brought it in big billion days of 55000 rupees. I am the lucky one who get it in 2019 as apple upgrade Mac book air in 2020 and now old version is not produce by company. This is best Mac book for students. None of windows laptop can beat the performance of this Mac book in same cost. And of course Mac operating system is more powerful as compared to windows in terms of coding or video editing.
3001,5,Worthy of money
3002,5,Awesome apple product. But I don't know how it's possible. I got sealed box but when I opened it I have found some scratches on the charger.
3003,5,Toooo good ... Can't believe this lappy is thinner than my realme smartphone
3004,5,Fall in love with this
3005,5,Good
3006,1,Received a Macbook with a big scratch on the back of display. I have applied for a replacement.
3007,5,üëçüëçmust have even its 2020
3008,5,Performance and battery are just amazing. That's all we need l.
3009,5,I am a Software Developer !! Ordered this after doing a very long research. Good for everything !! Nice battery (will update after 1-2months). Display is also good. One can use external monitor for photo or video editing. Go for it guys.  Will update a details review after using it for long time.
3010,5,Superb quality ‚ù§Ô∏è it
3011,5,Reviewing after one year of use. Pros- 1.Best performance and around 7-8 hours battery. 2.Best software experience.  Cons- 1.Bezels are slightly bigger as compared to other laptops. 2.You can't play games in this laptop because it's macosüòÅ .  Overall the best laptop for students for coding and video editing.
3012,5,Nice product
3013,5,"Great product, my daughter love it."

3018,5,Worth
3019,5,Mac‚ù§Ô∏è
3020,5,Excellent product ...but don't buy online ....go for stores ..
3021,4,"Couldn't find or get better then this. Wait for sale (offers) and buy it without thinking much if you're looking in this price segment. All features are just confined whether it is performance, speed, weight etc. Go for it."
3022,5,"Genuine product last 2 years I'm using. Thanks, Flipkart"
3023,5,Good
3024,5,"Best to use, work like a smartphone, so light and user friendly"
3025,5,I just love its battery backup. 12 hrs ‚ù§. And on off time is also less. Worth it.
3026,4,good
3027,5,The product is up to the mark and with the best performance in the league. But if you have a job of which require much more of connection and sharing then this will be a fussy for you because this require more task for that.
3028,5,"Product is good but never buy on HDFC EMI‚Äôs option either HDFC or FLIPCART is cheating,Deducted 4 extra EMI‚Äôs and now they are blaming on each other"
3029,5,Macbook air is awesome.
3030,5,"Apple macbook air is awesome if you are College student or you are doing some kind professional stuff but not useful for account professional because many account software run in window operating system's like tally not working in mac,Dsc not working in mac in india many thing required window operating system so before you buy it just go through these stuff."
3031,5,It's a fantastic laptop I have ever seen. I just love it.
3032,5,Best
3033,5,Superb Performance... As always Mac
3034,5,Very good...it is mind-blowing
3035,5,Go for it if you're looking for a laptop for day to day task
3036,5,I felt battery support is not good. Rest all is very good.
3037,1,It has not been a year I bought the product. But the sound stopped working one day. Few days after the charger stopped working. The performance was good but not sure what is wrong with the hardware. But it's a big dissapointment.
3038,5,Good
3039,5,It‚Äôs simply best feeling to use apple products . U could find the laptop distinct and variable from other laptop brands . Overall excited using the laptop every day .
3040,5,Rating this after 10 months. Bought for 64000rs. Delivery: Before time & perfect packaging. Software installation: They never force installation. Speed: Perfect speed as can be hoped from someone to obey the inputs. Battery life: 8-9+ hours after continuos surfing using wifi. As I had to do surfing most of the time. Sound quality: Speakers be like-find me if you can..As they are beneath the keyboard and provide perfect quality more than enough someone can hope for from this tiny piece of meta...
3041,5,Great product. Just loving it.
3042,5,Nice
3043,5,Go for it giving this revoew after 2 months .. very light weight.. once u will start using ig. U will know why apple.. üòÇüòÇ
3044,1,The worst product I have purchased in my life. Mother board corrupted in less than 2 years. I had to replace it for 20k. This is worst than a Chinese product. They are looting u on the basis of name only. It's better to buy HP product. Atleast they cost less and work fine for years.
3045,3,Quite good but you can get better specifications laptop in the same price.
3046,4,"After 10 Days of use,  Battery - screen time is around 6to7 hours. This is a concern.  OS updated from the mentioned to different.  Hope rest is well..... I will need some more time to detail more."
3047,5,sometimes the speakers are not working
3048,5,Overall its good but gets too overheated. Fan sound is very loud. Unexpected.
3049,5,Best for coders just loved the trackpad and the stability screen is not a problem if u are stopped by the screen the go for it its not the problem!!
3050,4,"It is a nice product, i did not notice any issues as of now"
3051,1,I bought it in 2018 but now not working at all. use other app(Amazon) for buying
3052,5,Very good
3053,5,Good Product.
3054,3,"Had purchased it in January and was working well for four months. The physical condition was good after a few months of usage. But suddenly it stopped booting properly, showed battery and heating issues. Tried resolving the issue by doing smc reset but it didn't work. Got a diagnosis done from one of the service centers and the problem was with its main board. Just four months of use and there were problems already!"
3055,5,Beautiful
3056,5,"Best laptop ever, class design, it is sleek and thin. It has fastest OS in the world. It is not just a laptop,but it is an experience."
3057,5,Bought MacBook air 2 years back. Working fine.Love it's sleek design
3058,1,My Macbook Air Camera is very bad. I think my laptop camera is changed by seller.
3059,4,Serial number in tax invoice and actual serial number are different. Having issue to register its warranty.  Rest everything is good.
3060,4,The laptop is beautifully designed and slick. The UI is very comfortable but the apple environment is still growing so there can be interoperability issues with other windows programs. Recently however I have been facing quality issues and had to pay to change the keyboard. With upgrade to Catalin now am facing wi fi issues. The policy of replacing parts makes maintenance very high. For the premium price we are paying I expected far better quality. So weigh the pros and cons before buying the...

3102,4,"Best quality, worth of money."
3103,5,A wonderful product.
3104,5,"Nice strong build, unlike the pro model.Only con is there is no in-built HDMI port. I think this is the last model where the apple logo shines."
3105,5,Battery backup and performance makes me happy
3106,5,Still the best laptop if we overlook the big bezzle'e and screen quality. For getting in the Apple Kingdom its the best you can get.
3107,3,"It won‚Äôt turn on after three years from purchase date! Unfortunately, I woke up to start working and finding my MacBook Air not starting. Tried all key combination- started after a couple of hours. But next day onwards- totally conked off. Battery is okay. It‚Äôs basically a three year investment. But performed very well ! Very sad about this."
3108,1,The laptop faced numerous issues 1. Blickering of the screen while watching videos 2. The RAM stopped working within 3.5 months
3109,5,Great laptop even in 2020
3110,5,"Pros: Great for regular use,outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.  Cons: Power adapter and bottom vent gets heated up very much"

But the reason I am giving 3 stars is the battery backup is not good . MacBook Air has an incredible battery backup 10-12 hrs. Unfortunately I GOT it for only 1 week . AFter that its 3-4 hrs max ."
3221,5,Perfectly packed and shipped. Highly satisfied with the performance.

3229,5,Apple is my favorite brand....This Mac was amazing
3230,5,Best in the business.
3231,5,Great experience.
3232,4,I bought this Laptop on Jan 2020. After 1 month of usage I feel everything is fine except the fonts.The fonts are blurry and pixeleted.After trying many methods i upgraded to Catalina but it did not resolve the issues.Looks like it's an issue with Mojave and Catalina for non-retina display.
3233,5,From 2013 I am using only Lenovo series laptop booted with Linux. Needed a new laptop so opted for this. very surprised with the smoothness the laptop runs.As for the SSD for more storage you can take a external hard disk. Very good buy
3234,4,Worth of money
3235,5,it is best for carrying. battery is good
3236,5,good product at great price
3237,5,very good

3250,2,Dear all. When I placed the order I was very confused about the quality and authenticity of the product. So after receiving the package I directly went to the Apple service Center and got my Mac book check. It is 100%genuine product.
3251,5,just amazing than i expected..it is just crowd puller laptop when you go to public places.feels so premium no windows laptop can compete this laptop in design performance .

3256,5,what can be better
3257,5,Apple is Awesome As Always. If You Wish To Go Blind üòÄ
3258,5,Overall performance is superb but display is disappointing. If one can manage with inferior display quality than it is a must go laptop at 50k range.
3259,5,"fits well for the price. The quality is hands down amazing. If you carry your laptop a lot, this is a lifesaver. For the purpose of video editing as well, fits perfect!"
3260,4,No worry if You are a professional otherwise it might be little fuzzy but overall only of its kind
3261,5,Value for money.

3801,5,Nice laptop . I am writing this after 15 day use. Best at this price
3802,1,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop. So one will end up wasting time and will have to deal with unnecessary haggling for no fault except buying a lemon product from Flipkart. Pathetic fine prints policy.

3853,1,Don't buy it. It taking longer time to switch on. And processing speed is very slow.

3861,4,"Good laptop for the money. Windows is unusable for me with default configuration (HDD, 4Gb ram). Upgrade ram as soon as you get it for better performance on dual channel memory. There is one empty ram slot and Lenovo manual says upto 12Gb total ram is supported. That is 8 GB ram can be installed in the slot. I've only added 4g. Please remember that 2Gb will be dedicated to the GPU and there's no option in bios to change this. So I had only 6Gb available ram for programs and services. It has o..."

I'm personally not satisfied with this product.
3865,3,"So the very first thing is 4gb ram which is way too low to do anything on this stylish and slim laptop. But thankfully it comes with an empty slot for the same. I had to buy kingston ddr4 8gb 2666mhz ram for Rs.2500 to actually get this laptop to work as otherwise it would utilize 80-85% ram on just opening a web browser. 8gb is the maximum additional upgrade allowed. You can buy 2400mhz or 2666mhz. Apart from that, you get original windows and ms office at this price! Antiglare screen is goo..."
3866,1,I am not satisfied with this laptop.this laptop is working slow. Screen brightness is low. Speaker is not good sound is low.i get this laptop in 26k. After 1 year keyboard and touchpad not working overall i am not satisfied with this laptop.
3867,4,Got this laptop in 24000 only . Best laptop For personal nd simple work . But If you want to do heavy work then you should buy SSD RAM variant for fast performance. Which having cost of 28000 I think . Overall good laptop Battery backup is 2-2.5 hours if you continuously use it.
3868,3,First of all I got this gadget in a very low price which was a cool deal with this specifications. No doubt specs are too good but here are some pros and cons after usage of two weeks approx.  Pros:  Design is really good and keys are smooth  Storage is also good  RAM  Genuine windows 10  Genuine microsoft office  AMD ryzen 3 processor  Light weight  Big display  Sound quality is crisp at a defined point  Battery charging time is almost 3 to 3.5 hours from 0 to 100  AMD enabled radeon graphic...
3869,4,"Product is worth five stars for the price of 22k-24k. Though I bought this @29k during lockdown since my old laptop crashed. If you can wait for the price drop to 22k-24k, go for this without any second thought. But for the price of @29k, i would recommend to go for ASUS having same specs but much better battery backup.  Pros: 1. Design is good, display is good. 2. Ryzen 3 is much better compared to i3 7th gen. 3. Comes with MS office 4. Speakers are good.  Cons: 1. Mouse touch pad is n..."
3870,5,It's a great laptop I got it under 29k best buy for me and just add 4gb ram to it and see the magic happen it's too good
3871,4,"I am using this laptop since 1year. No complaints. Running perfectly. But it is little bit slow response. It's because the storage device is hdd which has slow read rate. When I upgraded to ssd and 8GB ram , it is performance beast. It is also capable of running games in medium settings. Overall I will four star. Acer aspire 7 is more better than this. If we considering the budget. It is the best laptop"
3872,5,"I think this is one of the finest laptop i ever bought Looks good , best battery backup, performance is very fast with ryzen 3 dual core, Ryzen 3 dual core is far better than Intel i5 10th gen It will give u battery backup of around 5 hrs Go for it guys"
3873,4,"I'm gong to brief about the Pros and Cons only.  Pros - 1. Ryzen 3 Processor 2. AMD Vega 3 Graphics 3. FHD Screen 4. Light weight 5. Windows 10 and MsOffice pre installed 6. Looks  Cons - 1. Battery backup 2. TouchPad 3. Webcam  Now on a simple note for day to day office work or students assignments, surfing its a great deal. If you are thinking of gaming then don't go for it. Else product is good."
3874,4,I SO HAPPY THIS IS MY FIRST LAPTOP THANKS FLIPKART GIVE ME FAST DELIVERY AND GOOD SERVICE THERE IS NO FRAUD FROM FLIPKART YOU CAN TRUST THE FLIPKART
3875,4,"Honest Review  I am writing this review after using this laptop for almost 2 months. Overall quality is average unless you have upgraded RAM. I an waiting to purchase an 8GB RAM because RAM consumption is too much by the Windows App, 600MB is reserved by hardware as well. I haven't used any SSD powered laptop so I can't say buying it will speed up your performance or not but am sure with the RAM.  So when I play game (GTA IV) on this laptop. CPU usage is always around 30%-40% RAM usage is a..."
3876,5,"Build Quality is Not so Good, Track-pad is decent enough for daily use. Performance is good considering the price Thanks to Ryzen 3 3200U (Recommend to buy Variant with Ryzen 3 4000 series). Main bottleneck for this laptop is the HDD. Because of hard disk this laptop doesn't feel snappy(AMD is not to be blamed). I recommend Upgrading to SSD or buy a variant with SSD. Display is very good with decent viewing angles. 4 Hours + battery life with fast charging."
3877,4,It's really. Value for money. Performance wise it's good. Not to expect quick boot and fast multi tasking. But it's quite ok for daily single task activities. Laptop is not much sturdy. Noisy keyboard and noisy mouse pad. Probe to Scratch. 180 degree display is very supportive and still not giving confident not over usage. Though these are all not in harsh note. It's overall good product in this price point.
3878,5,"A good laptop in the price segment . Dont exoect it to run heavy gaming or work, it's good to go for moderate users like bwosing studying and work."
3879,5,Overall a good product for this price!! Display is good. Battery backup is around 4 hours. Speaker clarity is awesome.... But not more loud. Performance is better than i3 7th gen processor. Ram upgrade is must for improving the speed of the machine.
3880,5,"A really good product considering that it's so affordable, I recommend it to anyone who needs it for basic tasks like surfing, typing, school and office work in general. However, I would recommend that you upgrade the RAM a 4GB upgrade would be ok, but I recommend adding another 8GB as a lot of it is taken by background processes (I was even able to play GTA V with the 8GB upgrade) The only little problem I have aside that is the display is a little off coloured."
3881,3,"good laptop at reasonable prices .charger size is small, but speed is not up to the mark. ok for basic college work"
3882,4,"This is a must buy laptop if you wish to get a laptop in 30k as it includes graphics too If you wish to get a laptop for normal use it is the best laptop don't go for a second think to buy this , the display and the features are ausumn  One thing you need to keep in mind is the battery it last for 2, 3 hours on heavy usage. It sometimes hangs but after updates the laptop is working fine (it's an honest review)   I am Giving the review after using the laptop for a month"
3883,4,Got this 1 in offer by flipkart big billion days for just 2500....many suggestions i received in terms of low budget laptop..but i wanted to try this product...but this has led me so far aftr months of usage..it comes with great display atleast compared to other brands in this range...but rest all depends upon the user how he manages his pc. but to me its little slow in terms of opening an application but its fine manageable...overall its the most decent 1 i came accrossin this price range.
3884,5,It's awesome laptop doing great work when u creat account first time it's take time after that it's works excellent and battery is average and I get in 25k on big billion days and it's work smoothly
3885,3,first of all battery backup is not good design is good webcam is totally poor quality low grade plastic is used so build quality is zero performance is also not so good it takes approx 40_50 seconds to boot after installing all the drivers instead go for acer aspire ryzen 3 with better build quality and performance
3886,3,Worked fine till 6-7 months after that started lagging. Very slow performance. Battery backup is just 2 hours. Low end pc. Motherboard got damaged in just 11 months. The new motherboard replaced by lenovo is not working properly. I think it's not good for heavy usage. The laptop is not as good as expected.
3887,3,"This one is good if you are looking for general usage. Ram need to be extended for better performance. Camera should be enhanced more , currently it is poor. Other than this is ok for a student."
3888,5,"It's not the best laptop I've ever used but it's certainly the best bang for buck at this price. I invested some more into the laptop (added 8gb ram, replaced hdd with ssd) and the performance shot through the roof!  I have two issues though - the display chassis is a little too flimsy (wasn't expecting much at this price anyway), and the display itself is sub-par. I had to calibrate it manually to make it bearable but all's well if ends well.  In short, you can't get anything better at this..."
3889,4,This is my first ever purchase of laptop. I am using it for last 6 months and after that I'm reviewing the product. 1. The battery performance is medium. In power saving mode the performance is better. Upto 4 to 4.5 hours. 2. The screen sometimes become grey so clarity is medium. 3. Dolby sound system is very good. 4. The touch pad system is not upto the mark. It's better to use a mouse. 5. The build quality is also good in this price. 6. For better performance you just need to upgrade the R...
3890,5,"This is not a student laptop, but I would like to say it's also for professionals.  I can perform following things very smoothly:  Web development with .net framework Adobe Photoshop Android development Multitasking Smooth video editing like filmora AutoCAD MATLAB. Etc YouTube professionals work    Below are the issues In short it is not a software developer or engineers laptop. Better you look for i7 + 16 GB ram with 500ssd  -one more thing Ryzen 3 is best as compare to i3 for sure."
3891,5,Laptop is very good performance is very good and battery performance is also nice and charging is 65 word which charge the laptop at very low time performance is super at this the price point
3892,3,Lenovo is preloaded with default apps which makes the performance slow. Better to disable all those apps not to run on the start up to improve performance. Even I was literally feeling like returning but being an engineer thought give few more days.. suggest Lenovo team also to reduce the preloaded apps or send the technician who comes and does the first time installation and set up. This might be useful for common man  Lookwise it is awesome 500+ mb is dedicated to for display So we get 3.5 ...
3893,4,"Perfect home laptop. Good graphics. And appealing outlook. 15.1inch. and compact and wonderfull. It doesn't have the CD slot. The only disadvantage I found.  Apart from that's this is good with, teams, photoshop, Adobe premiere etc. Its awesome for those type of softwares. And its like good enaf."
3894,4,"Got it for 24k, good for the mentioned price, don't go for it above 25k, good thing is it can be extended ram and SSD, display is decent and viewing angle is not upto the mark."
3895,4,"Well, using it for several days and it never disappointed me so far. I was a little bit confused about AMD but then found Ryzen 3 3200U is actually better than Intel's i3 8th gen and it can compete even 10th gen in terms of clock speed.  Looks like one must update RAM since it's 4gb isn't enough for multitasking cause it's Slow and Sometimes hangs. And for further betterment one can go for SSDs(NVMe only otherwise replace the HDD)  Display is quite decent in comparison (in that price segment)..."
3896,4,Pro Decent product and built quality compared to price of laptop. Two side bezel definitely look good. R3 is great for light work ideal for office work which doesn't involve heavy software. Most importantly it is cheaper than I3. Keypad is great and button quality and finish is goods Preinstalled Windows and MS office greatly reduce your installation hassle and makes it perfect for non-tech users.  Cons It made in China. Though it has a Graphic card it is not a gaming laptop. Screen is brigh...
3897,5,Awsome laptop in affordable range! Must good going laptop for students and basic uses! Package is nicely.. full care has been taken.. Overall its worth it!
3898,4,Laptop is Best in 27K but 4Gb Ram is not Sufficient if you are a casual user then buy it other Wise its waste of money not recommended for Gaming or Editing
3899,4,I bought this laptop in big billion day sale. It has only 4gb ram. Better to upgrade extra 4gb. After adding extra ram it's work like charm. Battery backup is not that much good. But at this price what you expect. Sound quality is very low after enabling Dolby audio. If your budget is between 25k to 34k definitely buy this one . MS OFFICE is with life time validity. And McAfee Antivirus with 1 month of trial version
3900,4,"This laptop is good for a student like working in ms excel,word,powerpoint and editing and checking email.this laptop only comes in 4gb ram whch is soldered to the motherboard so u can grab another 8gb of ram from flipkart so u can make it much more powerful but not good as expected."
3901,5,"Excellent product. Early delivery by Flipkart. Good packing. No issue in operation of machine. No issue in activating preinstalled Windows 10 and MS Office 2019. Mcphy antivirus was preinstalled aswell. Overall a good purchase in INR 24490 including one year warranty. Those who are planning to buy core i3 9th generation may consider it as it's performance is no lesser than i3 8th generation and in most of the aspects of performance and several games, it leads i3 9th generation.

3902,5,"The laptop is very good in terms of daily office work and study, Do not expect it to out perform the specs. It is a decent laptop which will give you enough to get going. But if you want high speeds and extreme multi tasking, then go for a better one. If Study and office work( Spreadsheets, multiple chrome windows, drive etc.) is your concern then its just fine."

Use only screen with internet for video backup is 3:30hrs . Use any task with involved processor power . Backup time is 1:45Hrs which is not gud but in this Corona time all laptops and mobile are very high in price no laptops offer this type of specification in this price range design is ok not ...
3905,5,I purchased it for my younger one. Performance is pretty good and I like the way it is slim and handy at this price range.  Recommended product.!
3906,3,"The feel and design is pretty sleek and its genuinely light weighted. Battery performance is average but its good for office work &/or for Work from Home purpose. Biggest down side is that the speakers in this laptop is very low. Ryzen 3 vs Intel 3 was a challenge but if you are saving 2-3K with Ryzen, go for it. Overall satisfied with the product."

As per lenova service desk, RAM need to upgrade. But i dont think so. Looks like something abnormal with the laptop. Money wasted."

3957,4,"less than decent battery backup (less than 2.5 hrs), other aspects appear ok (used for about one month till date, mainly zoom meetings), sound from in-built speakers could have been louder"
3958,4,Best one to this price (23k) the main dispointment was ram its only 4gb. Due to this less ram performance get little bit lower
3959,5,"Worthy purchase even in 28k. All-rounder performance. Added extra 4GB DDR4 2400 RAM + NVMe m2 128 GB SSD. Now it loads four times faster than out of the box speed. Recommends for students , programmers and media streamers. Yet it plays most of the games having mid range graphics, not recommends for gaming or studio editing purposes."
3960,3,The laptop if using for multitasking without gaming then it needs to upgraded with SSD/RAM.  Else it will take few minutes to open applications and multitasking is very difficult especially if you are online and presenting.
3961,4,A best laptop at this range... It is very stylishly designed..... Display is good.... Amd ryzen 3 and 8th gen Mcafee is free for one month but they have mentioned 1 year..... Defects are: A cheap quality battery Battery life is tooo low.... Sound quality is bad..... They have mentioned dolby audio but it's tooooo low....

3983,2,If you sleep this laptop and reopen it takes 30 to 100sec It's very slow Not value for money after 1 month
3984,1,This laptop is very slow working. It taking 3 minutes for starting window. And after start its work Very slow. My money waste for this laptop. I never suggest to any one for buy this laptop.
3985,1,Worst product. Don't buy it. Very slow laptop. Don't waste your money. After a few months the keypad buttons also don't work properly. It's just full waste of money. It takes 10 minutes to boot. Very slow Device. Go for dell or hp
3986,5,Just Upgrade RAM To 8gb and see the performance!!! Budget Gaming!!!
3987,3,"The laptop is very slow and gets stuck a lot but...you can get rid of that problem if you increase the Random Access Memory. In the beginning my laptop was performing extremely slow. Then I added 8GB of the memory (Crucial Brand) and after that the performance improved significantly. 4GB of the memory is inbuilt, so if you add 8GB of that, the memory will become 12GB, which is enough for even gaming. Ryzen 3 processor is nice. So without the increased memory, the Laptop is trash but after you..."
3988,1,Performance is very poor. The newest laptop hangs so badly
3989,2,One of the worst laptops I have seen. It doesnt give the performance of Ryzen 3 processor. It is running far too slow than expected. Dont ever buy this laptop never look at 3.9 rating. Only way to make this laptop work good is to upgrade the RAM. Also the battery is too low. Power only lasts for 2.5 hours. This review is given after first time use. Also disk usage shows 10% in a brand new laptop.
3990,2,Very slow..if you open anything it takes lots of time to open...but other than that it's good...sound is very less..picture quality is nice.. although it's not up to the mark..next time if I buy laptop I'll definitely go for intel processor...AMD is worst
3991,5,Fabulous design with great keypad and touchpad
3992,2,"Very slow processing,less battery backup Don't go with this laptop if u want to do heavy tasking. It takes time to even open Google Chrome."
3993,1,Simply waste
3994,5,"This is best under budget and value for money , for better speed increase the RAM since it's only 4 gb"
3995,3,Laptop is slow but if you are going for this consider upgrading RAM to 8 or 12 gb else go for 4gb 256 ssd or 8gb 1tb hdd. After upgrade it works like a charm.
3996,5,Best in the segment....strong build quality even it is plastic made.....4 gb ram a bit sluggish because amd processor is damn good for it to use resources but chrome is a Ram- hungry devil ... Replace chrome with opera and install 8 gb of 2400 Mhz ram from crucial.....install additional ram will boost it ....go for it..if u want premium looks and best performance üòçüòç
3997,3,Only design is good in this laptop others things are worst the performance is very slow its taking too much time to open apps and it is hanging too much .and battery is also dropping very fast. I got very bad experience in this laptop.this is not value for money.
3998,4,"Good Entry Level laptop for everyday use. Just one suggestion, go for 8 gb Ram...or upgrade it later."
3999,4,Everything is fine. Note - need a ram (must) and ssd(optional) to work otherwise it's slow and also release heat.
4000,4,McAfee comes with 30 days subscription so I'm very sad

4007,4,Good laptop in this budget...
4008,5,Awesome
4009,1,"Value for Money, Pros: No heating problem, Low cost, Light weight, looks attractive, pre installed Office home student edition, 1 year unlimited device antivirus protection.  Cons: Slow, cant run heavy processes, no gamming please. Slow speed can be overcome to some extent by adding 8 GB Ram  re-rated to 1* Reason - Head phone jack loose connection is not covered under warranty plus service centre lacks staff who can fix it."
4010,3,Little bit slower but value for money

4022,3,It's an average product.. In this price range I would also suggest to see other alternatives..

4037,1,"I bought this laptop after seeing its features and thought that it is a good laptop in a low budget. But that was my mistake. Bad things: sound is very low (speakers are not that good). The system is extremely slow, it takes a very long time to start. It started to hang within 1 month (even I didn't installed any other software or game in it). The speed of system is very very slow. Even to see photographs or to transfer files in other folders it takes a lot of time. Good things: FHD, design i..."

4048,3,Ok
4049,4,"BEWARE!!!: MS office is only trial version of 7 days. When you ask about this with seller, they directly initiate returning of laptop. Crazy way of customer support.  But the laptop is awesome. For the price it's awesome. I upgraded it with 4GB additional RAM and 3 years Kaspersky Antivirus. Now it's one rocking machine...  I actually bought 2 laptops . One for sis and another one for dad. Because i liked it so much."

4075,2,"Sluggish performance, not at all good display. Poor sound quality and poor camera. Even if only Chrome is open, it would not be possible to open another application quickly. Not sure how come so many people rated it so high. It has only given me more stress than any delight of buying a new product.  Flipkart accepted to pick up the product and issue refund. I think they would have repacked and sold it to someone else and because of which the other person would have also gone through the same..."
4076,2,"I just use this product only 2 days. previously i used Hp intel pentium gold, since i used my old laptop 7 year's. and i feel more comfortable also have good battery back up. come to lenovo its take time to reboot the app's. also worst battery max 2.5- 3 yrs depend on works. also you cant use multi task at the time. come to processor compared to intel pentium gold, AMD ryzen not yet good. i suggesting in this budget you can get Hp brand laptop."
4077,5,Super laptop NYC look
4078,2,Battery is poor..2hrs maximum..hangs sometimes.. Not recommended. Windows 10 and Ms Office is there. The Design of the lap is good.

4093,3,I hate it. Its performance is very slow. It takes too much time open Ms excel. Now think about about the other applications. Think before you purchase this laptop.
4094,2,PC is very slow. Brought based on review from you tube. All are fake a good laptop will cost more. I can't even use smoothy for Normal office work. Any applications take at least 10-15 seconds for opening.

It is extremely slow and it's battery life is really bad. It gets irritating at time because it is too slow. And hang even while using a normal search engine. It would be better if you spend more 10000 and buy a better machine

4266,5,"Good laptop for good price.. even high-end games can be played with normal graphic settings though it has 4gb ram I can run mafia 2, assassin's Creed liberation hd at normal setting so it is a good product. Even GTA 4 can be run with full graphics"
4267,2,"Overall performance is very poor, this needs to be on a atleast 8 GB of RAM. Using MS Teams for online classes just peaks the memory usage to 100 literally rendering the laptop useless."

4313,3,Go to more ram 4 gb ram is not much better..go to more ram such as 8 gb or 12 gb ram...I upgraded to 12 gb..... now performance is better........
4314,1,Sometime os not working properly slow performance
4315,5,It's good product for daily use.
4316,4,Value product but you need to install ssd for better performance
4317,3,"After lot of research, I have bought it but the performance is not good, and it takes time to start up. Even sometimes when open a new tab its keep rolling up. The design looks fine."
4318,1,"Just 4 hours of use and the display is so poor I can watch a movie on my phone instead, the sound is so low can't even hear clear with the laptop on my lap"

4320,3,Very slow performance
4321,4,Very good in this budget.
4322,1,Dont buy this laptop
4323,4,Battery drain in about 3 to 4 hours other wise everything is ok
4324,1,Not so good it started hanging after only 10-12 days of usage.
4325,2,It is started hanging problem from very second use of it
4326,4,"Everything is good till now Battery could be better And The max briteness is not up to the need , it feels low when sunlight comes, could be 2 or 3 point more Else good One more complain why the hell price suddenly decreases from 30990 to 28990 after placing the order, it's unfair"
4327,2,Very Bed experience with processing and battery capacity.
4328,5,Good
4329,3,"You should add 8gb ram,or else its waste,it not 8gb ram i will compare it to pentium processor"
4330,3,"Very slow device. Even if you want to use it for educational purposes, jts not useful as it runs very slow. Now i need to spend extra to upgrade it with SSD memory or RAM"
4331,2,"Not satisfied,,,"
4332,5,Some time it very slow working and battery Draining so fast but in this price it is a valuable laptop.
4333,1,Hanging problem
4334,3,Better to buy laptop with 8 gb ram. Display is good. Performance slow with 4 gb ram.
4335,1,"Lot of noise was coming from fan+cpu assembly of laptop. So I have returned it. Also had issues with battery, only 2.5 hrs time with battery. Heating issues were also there."
4336,4,Very slow
4337,3,Cheap and best. Home and Student purpose ok.
4338,4,It does its job and is a good budget laptop but do keep in mind that it is not meant for gaming and adding extra 8gb RAM (as i did) gives much more stable perfomance.... I got it for 25k for that price its absolutely great!
4339,3,It's getting fan sound heavy
4340,5,Nice product
4341,1,Worst performance
4342,4,Good.......
4343,4,Only problem is battery drain fastly. Otherwise best product. Worth buying at this price
4344,3,"This is a entry level budget laptop and even has a good performance due to the AMD processor, gaming might be twitchy while playing mediocre game but handles every day daily task easily but might be a bit slow while multitasking, overall it is not 5 star but a manageable lap for students and entry level laptop learners I would say"
4345,4,Display and built quality could have been better ... over All ok for that price ...
4346,5,It is good for free fire üî•üî•üî•
4347,1,Poor defect product
4348,1,"Very bad quility product crusher/mouse stop working in middle of work every day ,also function key not working like F1& F2 ,f3 not working without press fn key,speed is too slow hanging problem"
4349,5,Nice laptop took for my brother.
4350,2,Perfomance is so bad. I can't even use the mouse properly. Only the design is good
4351,3,Starting it was okay but as days passed its geeting slow. After opening application its doing good. But it lags while opening the application
4352,4,Good laptop for mid range users not good for gaming. But no lag.
4353,3,It is a 'kaam chalau' laptop. Bought it for my Dad. The only thing he doesn't like about it is its trackpad which feels weird and too plasticy so we use a external mouse.
4354,3,Battery down fast.. Works slow Hanging many times As per this drawbacks price is very high.dont buy.
4355,5,Using from 2 months no issue occurred till now. Processor are good for this price. If you want to use for your online classes then go for it
4356,1,Worst product.. Huge fan sound within one month. No proper support from flipkart.
4357,3,Dear team no body help me for system installation please help me
4358,5,"Very good Product and features also stylish design, Full HD display etc."
4359,3,Not that great. Expected better performance from the specifications of the laptop.
4360,3,Average performance.. Look and feel nice...
4361,4,This laptop is very good at this price range but if you'll need onsite support then I must say their customer support is terrible unless you live in a developed area.
4362,1,Very slow and the keyboard is bad and fan sound coming inside overall very bad product Totally irritated by buying this product
4363,5,"It is just fine for everyday use. Working nice and fast as expected. You can play 8k video also, battery drains when you give multiple task and play high resolution video, but it can give you atleast 3 hour battery backup. It has windows 10 Home single version upgradeable to most recent 20H2."
4364,4,Awesome project
4365,5,the laptop is good.Build quality is also good.battery is average and nicely fast charged.performance is good
4366,5,Best product
4367,3,Battery is Just about of 1.7 hours something . Just Useless Battery ...The upper case that is the Monitor Panel is too light that....It moves like ...There is wind blowing....Very Light ...But Overall to use this...U just need to Attach Power Cable everytime...
4368,2,Worst product
4369,1,Very slow and sluggish. Intel laptops are based. Finally sold it out
4370,5,display:4/5 battery:3/5 keyboard:4.5/5 performance:4/5
4371,1,"Battery problem, low speed ,don‚Äôt waste a money"
4372,5,One of the the best product on this price range
4373,4,"It's a Budget Laptop, never expect a Gr8 performance. But a very Student required Performance"
4374,1,Waste of Money
4375,5,THE LAPTOP IS VERY GOOD AND YOU BELIEVE ME BUYER'S IF YOU ARE DECIDING TO BUY A LAPTOP WITHIN A RANGE OF 30K TO 32K YOU CAN EASILY AND WITHOUT THINKING TWICE GO FOR IT.. IT IS VERY BETTER THAN i3 8th generation THANK YOU!!
4376,4,Slow but it's ok.
4377,3,Sound quality is poor..Battery backup is average..Anti virus free for one month only..
4378,4,Nice Laptop with good built quality and performance. But sound is very low and battery backup not impressive.
4379,1,Too much lag I can't use it daily basis waste of money I lost my money but I wanted to save your money so if your bray is in right place so don't buy it
4380,5,"1. Worth the money i spend. I have got in 24 k in big billion sale. 2. Plays 4K video flawlessly. You can imagine the processing power it has. 3. Designed beautifully, looks like it's made of metal body. 4. Adapter wire is short 5. Screen is bright enough and sharp due to 1080p resolution 6. Boot time 20 second, shutdown time 5 second. 7. Battery backup is 3 hrs with movie playing with highest brightness and full volume."
4381,2,"Very bad machine 25k ,,very hangedd +takingvtime to much ,"
4382,5,Not bad
4383,5,Price to Performance ratio is very good. Works like a charm for standard multitasking. Design is a big plus. Looks very elegant and classy. Weight balancing is also pretty good. Battery life is average 4-5 hours. Would suggest everyone to increase the ram to atleast 8GB. Better than Intel i3 7th gen that you might get in this price bracket. A great buy. Satisfied with the product.
4384,5,good one
4385,3,Fast delivery just in 31 days..... Nice product worth @. 25 k
4386,2,"Service post delivery after raising complaints was bad. Multiple follow ups and end result was nothing. Things take time to load even with a blank laptop. Screen part of the laptop has no stability, shakes a lot. You need to press hard on the mouse pad not the smoothest. If bought will need to be upgraded with better RAM."
4387,5,Superb product lenovo
4388,5,This laptop is not for heavy work.
4389,4,Battery backup is only 4 hours
4390,4,This laptop design and display fine.then internet connectivity good.battery back up some butter.there wise product is good.

4397,2,Bettery is not better
4398,1,"Laptop is dead slow I never expected ghis from Lenovo especially, why did they released such an laptop. If we want to upgrade the memory also no info provided in bios regards to speed in MHz.  To those people who want to purchase this one kindly look for Other laptops."
4399,4,Ita worth it !!! According to the price range.
4400,5,Very handy and good looking nice performance
4401,2,"Very slow processing ,was not expecting from Lenovo."
4402,5,Great product in this price.

4405,3,"Not so great overall but decent for the price i got.  Preformance is just ok you need need atlest 8gb ram and ssd for better performance.  Battery life is mediocre.  Display is full HD although not so bright and viewing angle is poor.  Few keyboard in button didn't work at start got some solution online, but ut keep happening after windows update."

4412,1,"Very bad laptop, very slow, hanging problem due to dicount offer i got in low budjet but go for i3"
4413,2,I thought it's good laptop but after one day it became very slow I think I need to add more ram and SSD to it in order to use it.
4414,5,Just expect to update the ram to atleast another 4 gb.. Laptop isn't so slow as its own.. But when there's a heavy load it will lag.. You can make this a beast if you can upgrage the ram and ssd.
4415,4,Laptop accha hai but battery is not good
4416,5,It is very useful and the best laptop ever.
4417,3,Not having CD disc drive. I am surprised that laptop is not having disc drive. Hanged once with in week
4418,5,All is well
4419,2,"Laptop is light weight and stylish in design. As per product description on detail page, it comes with lifetime MS office and free one year subscription of McAfee, but in reality the MS office applications are not getting updated and applications are not working as well as the subscription is only a 20 days trial and you have to purchase separate paid subscription of McAfee. Well the delivery system of the product is horrible and got my laptop after whopping 10 days....."
4420,5,Laptop is working fine no issues of heating or hanging while working face by me. Battery backup is good and it can work upto three hours without charge. Overall fine performance.
4421,4,Average
4422,1,Don't buy this. There are a lot of problems in this laptop. After 2 weeks of purchase I am facing a lots of problems. The noise of the fan making it not useable day by day.

4427,1,Not getting warranty card with laptop.and Flipkart not giviing any response for that really really very horrible experience of Flipkart
4428,4,Good product
4429,4,Product is good.. but a very delayed service from Flipkart.. would never trust on Flipkart again for any items as commitment to customer is on least priority for them.
4430,1,"Cost to feature good deal, but quite sometime lags in performance. So overall disappointed. The windows update even can't go smoothly installed on the laptop. very pathetic / poor performance."
4431,4,Nice
4432,3,One thing is annoying in this laptop is its fan noise.
4433,4,Overall good machine for basic work.  Using aroun 8-9 hours a days.  Battery -3-4 hrs average  Display 4/5  Performance 4/5
4434,5,Amazing product at this priceüòçüòç
4435,5,Dont hesitate before buying it.. True reviews- Battery backup is low If you want to use it heavy upgrade the ram and ssd The 4gb 1 tb varient is pathetic.. But if you upgrade it you will love the performance
4436,3,its overall performance of battery is very low with in one hr the 100% battery draining out very bad performance
4437,5,"Value for money, I upgraded ram to 12 and its performance changed a lot, now i can play games like gta5"

4439,5,Nice
4440,5,Buy it....awesome product..ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
4441,3,"Over all ok, display quality is not good, performance is not bad."

4444,5,Very slim very light weight damn good looking laptop at this price I got grey color laptop very nice looking  Weight 1.85kg Performance ok for everyday tasks Screen is good full HD 1080p videos look great Battery I am getting 3 hours around ok for me
4445,5,"Very nice laptop McAfee not for 12 month, it's just trail version so u can uninstall this, Ur laptop become fast if u paused automatic updates, and uninstall Lenovo pre-installed software and uninstall antivirus.   So all is good in this laptop  Laptop start time is 40 to 50 second"
4446,4,Finally satisfied with the product at this price....
4447,1,laptop is very slow in performance and it hangs while opening 2-3 tab in chrome...don't buy...
4448,1,This laptop gets heated and making too loud noise.
4449,5,Nice... For student.... At low budget... I purchased in big billion days at 25240
4450,1,Microphone not working...touchpad is loosely fitted...poor build quality...delay flipkart delivery...never buy anything from lenovo...build poorly and in huge amount so the price is so less but it will hardly last for 2 years...batter to go for Asus Vivobook 15 or any higher brands like Dell or hp...if you compromise with quality...you will regret later...spend some more money and go for other brands if you dont want your laptop last for only 1 or 2 years...
4451,3,"Non of the windows drives were up to date, had to upgrade everything and until it was upgarded, MS office wont get installed.  Lags a lot, better to get the RAM upgraded. Not for gamers or heavy users"
4452,5,Excellent product... Flipkart please make sure that the item is delivered on the committed time...
4453,4,"One of the best laptops in the market at 26k ,I think I can't get better deal at this price. But the performance of the laptop is average what we can expect in this prise range Other wise it is a complete killer"
4454,5,If you get a DDR4 2400mhz ram it will run fast as lightning and because of dual channel and 2 gb vram it runs games like GTA5 and almost all Big titles in gaming with descent fps on low settings .Check its benchmarks on youtube it runs almost all games descently.
4455,2,Very very very slow.
4456,5,Fully value for money purchase.
4457,5,Good deal

4463,5,"Good Looking,Good Performance,Average battery life.....Overall A Good Pacage at this Price Range for Students....Go for it :)"
4464,3,"Battery life less than 3 hours. Display isnt upto the mark. Lenevo 30gb promotion with Dropbox offer doesnt work. Better to upgrade RAM as onboard 4 gb will not help in even basic tasks, will always lag. Not for heavy use. Ok for basic programming and studies."
4465,5,Nice product
4466,5,Best
4467,5,I am writing review after 10 days if purchase . It's good for study and professional purpose . I haven't tested it for gaming........1/11/2020..........

4488,3,"The performance of this laptop SUCKS, really , truly sucks.  Dont buy this laptop for any more than 25k, so you can afford a ram upgrade & probably a ssd.  The display is above average. The battery is poor. The look is great.  Performance is worse than a pentium laptop."
4489,4,In ad it was written that Microsoft Office app is preloaded whereas I find that only Microsoft 365 is loaded for one year only. Rest all is fine so far.
4490,2,Slow Laptop
4491,3,Performance abit slow
4492,3,"Back side pannel is not good, it is just plastic and ON /OFF button is given as key which is not looking good."
4493,4,Good product in mide range.
4494,1,"Processor Speed of üêå, takes a decade to turn on. Heats a lot even during normal operations."
4495,5,Good ‚ò∫Ô∏è
4496,5,Good laptop at this price point
4497,1,I hated this Too much bad products Not on on time We can't work what we want on time It's seem like dummy laptop
4498,5,Good product üëç
4499,3,"Design is good Sometime taking time to open any applicable like office , explorer even system is ideal. Battery is not upto Mark As per price 25k it is good for this product"
4500,2,Bat
4501,4,Just bought this laptop.fully satisfied.worth every single penny.only one flaw is battery backup that is quite small.but charging is fast so no concerns. Do not purchase if you are a heavy gamer or want to do too many tasks.overall this laptop is good for students and professionals.go for it if your budget is around 25k to 27k
4502,4,"At this price point this one is very good The problem i faced is about speakers,the sound quality is very poor.better to but a sound bar or any small rated speakers"
4503,3,Good
4504,4,Great laptop for beginners. Might operate slowly due to low ram capacity. Windows 10 is also great
4505,3,"ok not so fast , speaker volume is less i dont where dolby digital has been used , no keyboard light display .very slow opening .opening three apps systems gets stuck."
4506,5,It's good... battery upto 5 hours....design super
4507,4,Everything is good except battery backup... hardly 3 to 4hrs while browsing and 2hrs when zoom call is on. Good thing is it was getting changed with in 1hr 30mins
4508,4,It is best laptop under 40000. If your budget is higher than 40000 then go for other laptops Everything is fine but yellowish didplay
4509,4,"For the price it's an amazing product. A little sluggish at times, perfect for casual usage."
4510,4,Nyc
4511,5,Awesome laptop..
4512,4,"This laptop is pretty good for the price tag it comes with. Got it for 23k in the big billion day sale. the only drawback was the 4 gb ram...these days even phones dont work well with 4 gb ram. i would suggest anyone buying this should also get additional 8 gb ram along with it to make this laptop amazing. The highlight is the design, thin bezels and display..i dont think any other company is giving these specifications in this price range. i am Pretty happy with the purchase as i bought adat..."
4513,5,I have bought it at 25k at that price it is best. Battery life i average when connected to WiFi. And sometimes it lags also.
4514,1,"Error status is shown as ""Hard Disk"" not installed. Disappointed with purchase"
4515,3,Built quality is poor
4516,4,"The RAM should be upgraded else the performance is very slow, after the upgrade it is good"
4517,5,Very good laptop of this price.
4518,4,"Laptop is awesome .. Best laptop under 30k Better go with Amd ryzen 3 instead if Intel core i3 8th gen, Laptop delivered after 8 days of book date ,it's OK bcoz purchased on big billions days , happy with this laptop"
4519,4,Wonderful laptop
4520,3,"Camera is ridiculously bad ..no clarity ..want to understand whether it's the issue with the laptop recieved or its universal with this model ... Keyboard acts funny ..they are actually interchanged so if u want @ u need to press shift and "" to get it instead of shift and 2. ..."
4521,4,"The laptop looked great however the build quality could have been better (plastic body). Got MSO student version with it and one month trial Anti virus. Battery is good but that depends how Im using my laptop. AMD ryzen is a powerful range of processors, let's see how it holds up in future. Digital Dolby sounds great. Fast charging almost takes 90min to full charge from 5%. Decent webcam. Keyboard looks great but without backlit so in dark look hard. But the design looks sweet and slim."
4522,2,After using it for a month now I can say it's too slow even in day to day tasks. I don't know with 4 gb of ram and 1 tb of hard disk how a laptop can work too slow. I also think AMD Ryzen 3 processor performance is not up to the mark it's too slow u must go with intel processors.
4523,5,"Superbb product ,ryzen 3 is better than i3"
4524,3,not bad at this price
4525,5,Nice Look and Video clearly is good
4526,4,Good quality laptop....

4533,1,Laptop have been lagging in many times and stopped

4537,5,Good product
4538,5,Good battery life Good inbuilt quality Good delivery by flipkrt
4539,1,The quality is very bad
4540,4,"Good laptop in under 30K, 3 things need to be improved 1. Webcam is cheap. 2. Battery capacity is low 2-3 hrs 3. I can see finger prints in body 4. Processor fan noise level."
4541,5,This product is to much good and thank you flipkart
4542,5,I m Fully Satisfied üî•‚ù§
4543,3,"performance average lit bit slow , display colors not natural and camera is very poor"
4544,5,I think it is best laptop for students.you will get 4 gb ram but you have to upgrade ram to 8 gb for better performance.Otherwise you will get poor performance.battery is about 3-3.5 hours.Display is very good.
4545,5,Very very very super laptop all is good.
4546,4,If u want it for daily purpose...it's the best in the Range. And if u want to do some heavy work..I would recommend upgrade the Ram to 8Gb
4547,5,It's very nice I loved the slim body of the laptop the function the keys every thing.its excellent gud product to buy and use it nodoubt
4548,4,Good
4549,5,It's a very good laptop at the price of under 25k Only thing is that the 4GB Ram is not sufficient for this because in 4GB model it is little bit lagging...Rest all things is good specially build quality and weight...ü§©ü§©ü§©
4550,1,The laptop is completely waste of money it's getting to late to open and hanging tooo much it is not the good product ..waste of money and waste of time .we never expect this from flipkart
4551,3,Very very slow and too lagging
4552,1,Mcfee antivirus not working that was pre-installed for 1 year subscription free
4553,5,"Amazing product.Got it at a superb price of 24,640.Thank you so much Flipkart."
4554,5,Nice
4555,5,iI love this laptop in 26000 i am loving it laptop is one of best laptop in buget
4556,5,Value for money..... satisfied with the product
4557,2,Edited review.  Worst decision of my life buying this garbage. Utter waste
4558,4,"Hi,  It's been 4 months since I started using this laptop. I would like to say that it is a good beginners' device for basic functionality; no heating/hanging issues, tactile & responsive keyboard, good color saturation on the screen, charges fast and has moderate weight.  Overall, a good buy for the price."
4559,3,"Good design and light weight but performance is average because it's a budget laptop under 25k. Only for student or normal working or entertainment use, not suggest for multitasking or heavy use."
4560,4,Very nice product i love it .
4561,5,That's nice but performance will be batter after ram upgradation
4562,5,The display and build quality is damn good.Feels premium. Battery life is medium. 4.5 hours-5 hours on full charge. Processor speed is good enough. Ryzen 3 is better than i3 in terms of speed. Front camera is the only down side here.. its below average Overall it is awesome and probably best in the price range.. Theres a brand called Avita which offers higher specs like Ryzen 5 and 8gb ram in similiar price range but again its risky as its not a renowned brand and after sales service can be h...
4563,4,GOOD FOR STUDENTS AND OFFICE WORK
4564,3,"Build quality is good. Sound is very bad, lenevo should improve this. Display is ok. Battery backup is bad."
4565,3,A must buy laptop under 25k!!
4566,2,Slow perfamence
4567,5,Display screen is not that steady.Initially struggle to activate office. Overall good budget laptop
4568,1,"You cannot open 3apps simultaneously, for the same prize you can prefer avita ryzen 5 with 550gb add"
4569,1,It take ages to start .. nothing installed yet takes 20 min for bootup... Better buy some other brand
4570,3,"With 4 gb memory, we are not supposed to work on windows 10... too slow..."
4571,5,Good
4572,5,A nice handy product from Lenovo. Ryzen 3 is performing outstandingly. Sound quality is top class. Overall a fine product.
4573,4,Nice laptop with awesome build quality in this price point. Best buy if you are going to do just browsing and simple tasks on laptop.. Best value for money.
4574,2,Laptop get hanged in normal uses. Keep hanging at start and need reset of pc again and again
4575,5,Good
4576,1,Keyboard is not working
4577,5,Worth buy
4578,5,"Using this for 2.5 months now. Primarily to attend Online meetings, Online Classes, Email and working on documents. No complaints at all now. Affordable, looks good, works well. Hope the nice experience continues."
4579,1,System is very slow. It will take atleast 15 minutes to open. After that if you try to open a word document again it will take 30 mnts. Please don't go for this.
4580,3,good
4581,4,good laptop at this price but speaker quality is not good and little heat issue
4582,2,Very sluggish
4583,3,Average Performance
4584,5,Nice Product
4585,1,Very pathetic performance.it gets hanged even if you is being played.not for multitasking. HD video is also seems as a normal standard video
4586,2,"Poor performance, battery backup is too low"
4587,4,Good budget laptop. I was sluggish initially... But was good after few configuration setting changes. The viewing angle of the display isn't good. It can be used for basic office work and online learning
4588,4,"This is the best laptop you can get at this price range, works well for all basic usage, softwares like Photoshop, Movavi Video Editor, etc. also works very smooth üòä"
4589,5,Nice productüòä
4590,5,Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..
4591,4,As usual value for money device.. one thing that attracts me the most is Stereo speakers.. Awesome sound quality.. FHD+ Display is so nice and 6000mH battery as well.. Decent product from Redmi. Go for it Camera quality also decent üôÇ
4592,4,Quality wise good. Good performance of the prize. Cam quality was good what ever it as simply awsome.. üòáüòò
4593,5,"What else do one expects in this price range? Hm... Best in its segment literally, talking about cameras, battery, performance, display and everything else (including Xiaomi MiUi) bestest ever! It's my daddy's smartphone, he'd be greatly using it... I do recommend to go for it, it's just awesome. Here are some shots and a ss for authentication, yes go for it! It's just a perfect phone for everyone (here ""everyone"" means literally ""everyone"") thanks Flipkart and Redmi too!!"
4594,5,I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance üòä
4595,5,I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò
4596,4,After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.
4597,5,Nice product in the price range and battery performance is too good ...camera quality is also good and speakers are so good ....love the device üòäüòä
4598,4,Awesome mobile smooth work fantastic I love this product my brother is so happy
4599,4,I am using this phone for three days. Speed is good üëçüëç display is cool with a waterdrop notch. Good backup battery. For a budget phone i hada great experience.
4600,5,Nice phone i am very happy camer is good I like it Redmi 9 power
4601,3,"Writing my reviews after 4 days of use. Pros. 1. Side mounted finger senser, it works well. 2. Battery backup is good, easily lasts for a day. 3. Fast charging, works well Cons. 1. Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge..."
4602,5,"Very Smart and Nice looking with Excellent technical specification 4 gb RAM and 64gb ROM, 6000 mAH better long battery work mobile 2 days.. As. Per price very Nice Mobile"
4603,4,"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product."
4604,5,I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.
4605,5,"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you üòä"
4606,4,"The mobile is awesome. Had ordered it for my aunt. She was previously using Nokia feature mobile. This is her first smartphone. She is able to use is easily. Pros 1 Superb Battery 2 Good Display 3 Nice Connectivity  Cons 1 Camera is below average 2 The side mounted finger print sometimes don't recognize the finger 3 Mobile feels bigger in hand 4 Charging take almost 2 hrs  But for the price range, the mobile is good."
4607,3,Review after 2months. Budget phone. In this price specification is good. Battery backup is moderate in heavy use but in ideal mode is good. Require +3hour for 0 to100%full charged. Back camera is good but as per 48Megapixel is average. Selfi camera is not good. Body is plastic fiber so is good. Design is awesome. Performance wise is ok. Rating:out of 5star Camera : ‚≠ê‚≠ê Battery :‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Performance:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Design:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Procesor:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
4608,4,Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you Battery is like 4000 mh And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10
4609,5,"Excellent performance in every aspect but didn't felt the difference b/w 48m & other cameras, all click excellent pictures. The phone size is too big & you can't handle it with one hand. It's quite heavy. Looks stunning though"
4610,5,At this Price range amazing and fabulous Device... I loved it but back of mobile is big Redmi Branding it is too bad. Xiaomi Please keep branding in small font.
4611,3,"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price."
4612,3,This Smart phone is very good phn.On gaming this is the best phn in few money..
4613,5,"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!"
4614,5,"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days. My opinion  FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.  BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..  Display : display looks clear & very good  Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing  Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..   Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10"
4615,3,This phone performance is Good But It's Not the Best . Battery backup is also Good Because of The SD 662 11nm Processor.  But there is some issues with the Camera.Quality is not good as expected Front Camera Quality is very poor than REDMI 6 even it has 5MP sensor and 3 Year Old.  And Display produce good picture quality But Display is little bit yellowish and not bright compare to Other Phones.  My Conclusions is if you are looking for Camera and Display then this is not for You.
4616,5,It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent Over all it's a good phone at the price
4617,5,The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.
4618,4,Nice üëç product at this prize battery is amazing but display quality is as compair to other mi phone not God but nice at this prize range
4619,5,"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good."
4620,4,Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone
4621,5,1. Notifications LED is not available. 2. Double tapping screen lock feature is not available from home screen. (Only screen on/off is available when screen is lock)
4622,5,Very nice and photo clarity super battery power good
4623,3,"WRITING A REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS USAGE Camera : IT IS OKAY TYPE BATTERY:ON NORMAL USE(6-7 hrs) it lasts about 1 day DISPLAY: NO PROBLEMS TILL NOW,So Far so good VALUE FOR MONEY:ü§îWorth it definitely üëçüèª  PERFORMANCE: GOOD,  IF PERFORMANCE IS A CRITERIA For you THEN YOU CAN GO FOR 6GB VARIANT(I HAD BOUGHT 4 64)  A GOOD IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR YOUR PARENTS,but go for 6 GB it is better in long term usage.Happy buying!  ALSO IN AN LITTLE BUDGET YOU CAN BUY REALME NARZO 30 4G(DO CHECK IT)üëçüèª"
4624,5,Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item. Thanks.
4625,5,Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it
4626,5,Under 10k I think this is one of the most powerful phone. The camera works decently and takes clear crisp photos. It easily goes for a day with high usage and 2_3 days with minimum use. The display is large and sharp for watching videos. Performance wise it provides smooth actions.
4627,4,It's a good phone for normal users.  I used redmi note 4 for last 4 years but redmi 9 power is not as fast as note 4.  After taking picture in camera preview pic is blur for one second then become clear image.  Battery is really fantastic  Camera is good in daylight and low light not so good.  Sound is loud enough.  Network signal strength is not good.
4628,5,It's a really a good value for money the best part about this phone is its battery backup but the charger is too slow to charge the phone as its only 22watts but the phone only support 18watts but the performance wise it's good but if you play heavy games more than an hour then you might see some frame drops But after the update the problem is solved
4629,5,Best Price This year best battery back up mobile Very fast delivery flipkart Stereo speakersüîä superb Full HD screen awesome.. Totally nice.. I like it
4630,5,"Very fast delivery from Flipkart. Thanks. Redmi 9 Power has very powerful batteryüîã backup. Must buy, who want longer battery backup. Worth buy mobile in this price segment."
4631,3,Nice phone in correct price.. U should also try this phone Good quality of display and battery but something is missing like front flashlight
4632,4,.It has a good battery life . .Once fully charged if you are a normal user It will easily last for 1 and half day .Display is OK. It's not having much brightness when we put it on full brightness. .Because of 18 w fast charging it charges within 2 hr 15 min Front camera is not that much good. 48 MP main camera is good .I just used it for 1 week
4633,5,"If you need a good battery backup for 2 days it's a Excellent device having good processor, but if you are a Music Lover need good high pitch and volume you will be upset. Brightness in sun is also low."
4634,5,"Honest review after a month  Sound quality just amazing Display is really good at such price point Battery backup cames for a complete day even at heavy usage Gaming experience not upto the mark as I found many frame drops but you can play BGMI at low settings, always keep in mind it's not an gaming device Looks and design just steal the heart, wonderful  Under such price sigment  Overall for daily usage it's really amazing device"
4635,5,"Power packed performance, absolutely loved it!! Initially I had a confusion in choosing this phone. Finally i zeroed my search to samsung F11 and Redmi Power: But now I realise that my choice is right about Redmi 9 Power‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° Thanks flipkart for one time delivery!!

4636,4,Fiery red colour is excellent Battery backup is also very good Camera quality is best Phone was slim and light weight Value for money
4637,3,Performance is very good and battery is quickly charging and this battery is available upto 24 hours only and camera performance is not equal to 48mega pixel. If you want to good camera please don't buy this mobile. This mobile is very weight for me. Display is good.
4638,5,"It's a decent phone I'm writing this review after the 2 days of use. Everything is good. When I ordered I was slightly concerned about the big branding at the back side but after putting the case on ( which was inside the box) it looks good and the branding doesn't feel like it's there. I don't play games so can't say much about gaming experience, but in regular uses this is really smooth. No ads till now. I think it is best at this price point."
4639,5,"Nice budget phone, camera is pretty good and battery is main attraction in this phone, display is very good. Totally a good phone under this price range"
4640,4,"Its quite good, but camera has got quite sharpness, battery is good, display is like ok, well overall gives good performance with good chipset."

4646,5,"This phone is good for this budget. Phone back camera are quite good but front camera I give 6 out of 10. The process is great but battery backup are same as like 5000 mph. So, if your are 10k I will recommend this phone‚ù§Ô∏è"

4648,5,Nice mobile at this price point. Surprisingly it comes with IR blaster and the mobile is water proof and also have stereo speaker. Snapdragon 662 is a decent processor with decent gaming performance. Anyway uts a nice mobile at this price.
4649,3,I'm satisfied with this mobile..actually i am first time using mi ui I'm fan of stok android but this is pretty good worth it
4650,4,Only issue is there is no charging indicator LED. Nor there is notifications indicating LED on phone. Rest all is amazing. This is my first week of use. I will post again my review after a month or so.  Overall it's a good deal at this price. Looks promising and premium phone overall.

5218,3,I was using redmi note 5 before i buy redmi 9 power. The quality of camera is not upto mark. I felt even some lower priced and previous versions of redmi gives better camera output. The light from flashlight is lesser than note 5. Power of wifi receiver is very less and i find difficulty in receiving signal when i am not so close to the wifi modem. Even my 2016 model phone picks wifi signals better than redmi power.

5256,2,value for money only. if u are looking for avg phone with average speed having 4GB doesn't make any sense. performance is average. Camera quality is worst. If you are looking for a good camera then this choice would be incorrect.
5257,5,The 9 power is amazing budget mobile without compromising necessary features. Battery capacity is the most important one ( stands for 2 days for normal usage ) . UI is also good if you disable the bloatware during initial setup process. Can handle all the daily tasks for a typical user and there is no lag during usage

5797,1,The software is rubbish. Wifi automatically connects and disconnected even after motherboard replacement. Camera is worst of its kind at night. Bluetooth is also rubbish... Can't connect with wireless earphone
5798,3,An average product. I bought this phone for my brother 7 months ago. Battery back up is good. But facing hardware issues like power button and volume button are not working since a month. He called xiaomi customer care and they told him to visit service centre. Another issue is frequent restart which demands user to do several tricks like switching off phone and or performing hard reset. For this issue also customer care advised us to do reset or visit service store. It is really astonishing ...

Phone is heavy, might be because of battery. Fiery red is an attraction on advertisement, on reality it doesn't matched expectation with respect to color and appearance. I would rather think, this phone could had been in the price range of 8500INR to make it the 5 star. Wifi connectivity/ signal capturing is worse when compared to othe..."

7568,5,Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..
7569,5,As usual value for money device.. one thing that attracts me the most is Stereo speakers.. Awesome sound quality.. FHD+ Display is so nice and 6000mH battery as well.. Decent product from Redmi. Go for it Camera quality also decent üôÇ
7570,3,Quality wise good. Good performance of the prize. Cam quality was good what ever it as simply awsome.. üòáüòò
7571,5,"What else do one expects in this price range? Hm... Best in its segment literally, talking about cameras, battery, performance, display and everything else (including Xiaomi MiUi) bestest ever! It's my daddy's smartphone, he'd be greatly using it... I do recommend to go for it, it's just awesome. Here are some shots and a ss for authentication, yes go for it! It's just a perfect phone for everyone (here ""everyone"" means literally ""everyone"") thanks Flipkart and Redmi too!!"
7572,5,I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance üòä
7573,5,I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò
7574,5,After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.
7575,4,Nice product in the price range and battery performance is too good ...camera quality is also good and speakers are so good ....love the device üòäüòä
7576,5,Awesome mobile smooth work fantastic I love this product my brother is so happy
7577,5,I am using this phone for three days. Speed is good üëçüëç display is cool with a waterdrop notch. Good backup battery. For a budget phone i hada great experience.
7578,5,Nice phone i am very happy camer is good I like it Redmi 9 power
7579,5,"Writing my reviews after 4 days of use. Pros. 1. Side mounted finger senser, it works well. 2. Battery backup is good, easily lasts for a day. 3. Fast charging, works well Cons. 1. Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge..."
7580,4,"Very Smart and Nice looking with Excellent technical specification 4 gb RAM and 64gb ROM, 6000 mAH better long battery work mobile 2 days.. As. Per price very Nice Mobile"
7581,4,"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product."
7582,5,I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.
7583,5,"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you üòä"
7584,5,"The mobile is awesome. Had ordered it for my aunt. She was previously using Nokia feature mobile. This is her first smartphone. She is able to use is easily. Pros 1 Superb Battery 2 Good Display 3 Nice Connectivity  Cons 1 Camera is below average 2 The side mounted finger print sometimes don't recognize the finger 3 Mobile feels bigger in hand 4 Charging take almost 2 hrs  But for the price range, the mobile is good."
7585,4,Review after 2months. Budget phone. In this price specification is good. Battery backup is moderate in heavy use but in ideal mode is good. Require +3hour for 0 to100%full charged. Back camera is good but as per 48Megapixel is average. Selfi camera is not good. Body is plastic fiber so is good. Design is awesome. Performance wise is ok. Rating:out of 5star Camera : ‚≠ê‚≠ê Battery :‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Performance:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Design:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Procesor:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
7586,5,Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you Battery is like 4000 mh And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10
7587,4,"Excellent performance in every aspect but didn't felt the difference b/w 48m & other cameras, all click excellent pictures. The phone size is too big & you can't handle it with one hand. It's quite heavy. Looks stunning though"
7588,4,At this Price range amazing and fabulous Device... I loved it but back of mobile is big Redmi Branding it is too bad. Xiaomi Please keep branding in small font.
7589,5,"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price."
7590,3,This Smart phone is very good phn.On gaming this is the best phn in few money..
7591,5,"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!"
7592,4,"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days. My opinion  FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.  BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..  Display : display looks clear & very good  Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing  Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..   Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10"
7593,5,This phone performance is Good But It's Not the Best . Battery backup is also Good Because of The SD 662 11nm Processor.  But there is some issues with the Camera.Quality is not good as expected Front Camera Quality is very poor than REDMI 6 even it has 5MP sensor and 3 Year Old.  And Display produce good picture quality But Display is little bit yellowish and not bright compare to Other Phones.  My Conclusions is if you are looking for Camera and Display then this is not for You.
7594,5,It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent Over all it's a good phone at the price
7595,4,The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.
7596,3,Nice üëç product at this prize battery is amazing but display quality is as compair to other mi phone not God but nice at this prize range
7597,4,"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good."
7598,5,Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone
7599,5,1. Notifications LED is not available. 2. Double tapping screen lock feature is not available from home screen. (Only screen on/off is available when screen is lock)
7600,3,Very nice and photo clarity super battery power good
7601,3,"WRITING A REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS USAGE Camera : IT IS OKAY TYPE BATTERY:ON NORMAL USE(6-7 hrs) it lasts about 1 day DISPLAY: NO PROBLEMS TILL NOW,So Far so good VALUE FOR MONEY:ü§îWorth it definitely üëçüèª  PERFORMANCE: GOOD,  IF PERFORMANCE IS A CRITERIA For you THEN YOU CAN GO FOR 6GB VARIANT(I HAD BOUGHT 4 64)  A GOOD IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR YOUR PARENTS,but go for 6 GB it is better in long term usage.Happy buying!  ALSO IN AN LITTLE BUDGET YOU CAN BUY REALME NARZO 30 4G(DO CHECK IT)üëçüèª"
7602,5,Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item. Thanks.
7603,5,Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it
7604,3,Under 10k I think this is one of the most powerful phone. The camera works decently and takes clear crisp photos. It easily goes for a day with high usage and 2_3 days with minimum use. The display is large and sharp for watching videos. Performance wise it provides smooth actions.
7605,5,It's a good phone for normal users.  I used redmi note 4 for last 4 years but redmi 9 power is not as fast as note 4.  After taking picture in camera preview pic is blur for one second then become clear image.  Battery is really fantastic  Camera is good in daylight and low light not so good.  Sound is loud enough.  Network signal strength is not good.
7606,5,It's a really a good value for money the best part about this phone is its battery backup but the charger is too slow to charge the phone as its only 22watts but the phone only support 18watts but the performance wise it's good but if you play heavy games more than an hour then you might see some frame drops But after the update the problem is solved
7607,4,Best Price This year best battery back up mobile Very fast delivery flipkart Stereo speakersüîä superb Full HD screen awesome.. Totally nice.. I like it
7608,5,"Very fast delivery from Flipkart. Thanks. Redmi 9 Power has very powerful batteryüîã backup. Must buy, who want longer battery backup. Worth buy mobile in this price segment."
7609,4,Nice phone in correct price.. U should also try this phone Good quality of display and battery but something is missing like front flashlight
7610,5,.It has a good battery life . .Once fully charged if you are a normal user It will easily last for 1 and half day .Display is OK. It's not having much brightness when we put it on full brightness. .Because of 18 w fast charging it charges within 2 hr 15 min Front camera is not that much good. 48 MP main camera is good .I just used it for 1 week
7611,5,"If you need a good battery backup for 2 days it's a Excellent device having good processor, but if you are a Music Lover need good high pitch and volume you will be upset. Brightness in sun is also low."
7612,3,"Honest review after a month  Sound quality just amazing Display is really good at such price point Battery backup cames for a complete day even at heavy usage Gaming experience not upto the mark as I found many frame drops but you can play BGMI at low settings, always keep in mind it's not an gaming device Looks and design just steal the heart, wonderful  Under such price sigment  Overall for daily usage it's really amazing device"
7613,5,"Power packed performance, absolutely loved it!! Initially I had a confusion in choosing this phone. Finally i zeroed my search to samsung F11 and Redmi Power: But now I realise that my choice is right about Redmi 9 Power‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° Thanks flipkart for one time delivery!! Battery lasts 2~3 days easily with moderate usage!! I am satisfied with my new phone, easily I will recommend my friends as well!!!!

7614,5,Fiery red colour is excellent Battery backup is also very good Camera quality is best Phone was slim and light weight Value for money
7615,5,Performance is very good and battery is quickly charging and this battery is available upto 24 hours only and camera performance is not equal to 48mega pixel. If you want to good camera please don't buy this mobile. This mobile is very weight for me. Display is good.
7616,4,"It's a decent phone I'm writing this review after the 2 days of use. Everything is good. When I ordered I was slightly concerned about the big branding at the back side but after putting the case on ( which was inside the box) it looks good and the branding doesn't feel like it's there. I don't play games so can't say much about gaming experience, but in regular uses this is really smooth. No ads till now. I think it is best at this price point."
7617,5,"Nice budget phone, camera is pretty good and battery is main attraction in this phone, display is very good. Totally a good phone under this price range"
7618,5,"Its quite good, but camera has got quite sharpness, battery is good, display is like ok, well overall gives good performance with good chipset."
7619,5,Its a great phone at this price range. Worth the price.. amazing camera. Lovely built quality. Loved it!
7620,3,At this price it's a very good product. The quality of its camera is fantastic and battery backup is also good. What i love most about this product is the display superb display full of HD.
7621,4,Excellent mobile  Good camera Good design Good battery backup Overall tremendous Mobile I recommend this mobile for low budget customers Thanks flipkart for very good and fair delivery
7622,5,Good but front camera is not good but phone is best all things are suberb only front camera ..
7623,5,"It is a very good phone with good features at this price point. The camera is good for this price point, processor is also good, and battery is superb. This phone is made for the daily normal usage and not very heavy games and the phone works very smooth with normal and daily use."
7624,5,"This phone is good for this budget. Phone back camera are quite good but front camera I give 6 out of 10. The process is great but battery backup are same as like 5000 mph. So, if your are 10k I will recommend this phone‚ù§Ô∏è"
7625,4,"Just awesome, mind blowing purchase. Thanks a lot flipkart for wonder offers. Special thanks to e-kart because early morning 09:05a.m delivery my lovely products. Thanks a lot.

7626,3,Nice mobile at this price point. Surprisingly it comes with IR blaster and the mobile is water proof and also have stereo speaker. Snapdragon 662 is a decent processor with decent gaming performance. Anyway uts a nice mobile at this price.
7627,5,I'm satisfied with this mobile..actually i am first time using mi ui I'm fan of stok android but this is pretty good worth it
7628,5,Only issue is there is no charging indicator LED. Nor there is notifications indicating LED on phone. Rest all is amazing. This is my first week of use. I will post again my review after a month or so.  Overall it's a good deal at this price. Looks promising and premium phone overall.

8226,5,I was using redmi note 5 before i buy redmi 9 power. The quality of camera is not upto mark. I felt even some lower priced and previous versions of redmi gives better camera output. The light from flashlight is lesser than note 5. Power of wifi receiver is very less and i find difficulty in receiving signal when i am not so close to the wifi modem. Even my 2016 model phone picks wifi signals better than redmi power.

8288,4,Nice product
8289,5,At this price range there are many other(mobile) option are available. Camera 48 mega pixel is just to highlight the customer. It gives the quality as 8 mega pixel. Brightness level is also very low in daylight even after it is full. Battery is Ok but to full charge it takes almost 2 hours 45 minutes.
8290,5,Please don't exchange Mobile on Flipkart they are cheat us
8291,5,After 20 days mobile got hangout
8292,1,Nice product Camera & battery is very good
8293,1,After using this phone I got battery drainage problems I'd comparatively fast . Camera is not good screen is overall good
8294,5,value for money only. if u are looking for avg phone with average speed having 4GB doesn't make any sense. performance is average. Camera quality is worst. If you are looking for a good camera then this choice would be incorrect.
8295,4,The 9 power is amazing budget mobile without compromising necessary features. Battery capacity is the most important one ( stands for 2 days for normal usage ) . UI is also good if you disable the bloatware during initial setup process. Can handle all the daily tasks for a typical user and there is no lag during usage
8296,5,Delivered in just 2 days. Good looking. ‚ú® Better battery backup. Faster. Worth the moneyüëå Sd processor is worth with lesser phone heat. Perfect pick for homemaker womanüë©

8352,3,Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..
8353,2,As usual value for money device.. one thing that attracts me the most is Stereo speakers.. Awesome sound quality.. FHD+ Display is so nice and 6000mH battery as well.. Decent product from Redmi. Go for it Camera quality also decent üôÇ
8354,5,Quality wise good. Good performance of the prize. Cam quality was good what ever it as simply awsome.. üòáüòò
8355,5,"What else do one expects in this price range? Hm... Best in its segment literally, talking about cameras, battery, performance, display and everything else (including Xiaomi MiUi) bestest ever! It's my daddy's smartphone, he'd be greatly using it... I do recommend to go for it, it's just awesome. Here are some shots and a ss for authentication, yes go for it! It's just a perfect phone for everyone (here ""everyone"" means literally ""everyone"") thanks Flipkart and Redmi too!!"
8356,5,I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance üòä
8357,4,I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò
8358,2,After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.
8359,4,Nice product in the price range and battery performance is too good ...camera quality is also good and speakers are so good ....love the device üòäüòä

8363,2,"Writing my reviews after 4 days of use. Pros. 1. Side mounted finger senser, it works well. 2. Battery backup is good, easily lasts for a day. 3. Fast charging, works well Cons. 1. Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge..."
8364,5,"Very Smart and Nice looking with Excellent technical specification 4 gb RAM and 64gb ROM, 6000 mAH better long battery work mobile 2 days.. As. Per price very Nice Mobile"
8365,5,"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product."
8366,5,I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.
8367,4,"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you üòä"
8368,2,"The mobile is awesome. Had ordered it for my aunt. She was previously using Nokia feature mobile. This is her first smartphone. She is able to use is easily. Pros 1 Superb Battery 2 Good Display 3 Nice Connectivity  Cons 1 Camera is below average 2 The side mounted finger print sometimes don't recognize the finger 3 Mobile feels bigger in hand 4 Charging take almost 2 hrs  But for the price range, the mobile is good."
8369,5,Review after 2months. Budget phone. In this price specification is good. Battery backup is moderate in heavy use but in ideal mode is good. Require +3hour for 0 to100%full charged. Back camera is good but as per 48Megapixel is average. Selfi camera is not good. Body is plastic fiber so is good. Design is awesome. Performance wise is ok. Rating:out of 5star Camera : ‚≠ê‚≠ê Battery :‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Performance:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Design:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Procesor:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
8370,4,Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you Battery is like 4000 mh And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10
8371,4,"Excellent performance in every aspect but didn't felt the difference b/w 48m & other cameras, all click excellent pictures. The phone size is too big & you can't handle it with one hand. It's quite heavy. Looks stunning though"
8372,5,At this Price range amazing and fabulous Device... I loved it but back of mobile is big Redmi Branding it is too bad. Xiaomi Please keep branding in small font.
8373,5,"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price."
8374,5,This Smart phone is very good phn.On gaming this is the best phn in few money..
8375,4,"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!"
8376,5,"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days. My opinion  FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.  BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..  Display : display looks clear & very good  Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing  Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..   Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10"
8377,4,This phone performance is Good But It's Not the Best . Battery backup is also Good Because of The SD 662 11nm Processor.  But there is some issues with the Camera.Quality is not good as expected Front Camera Quality is very poor than REDMI 6 even it has 5MP sensor and 3 Year Old.  And Display produce good picture quality But Display is little bit yellowish and not bright compare to Other Phones.  My Conclusions is if you are looking for Camera and Display then this is not for You.
8378,4,It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent Over all it's a good phone at the price
8379,5,The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.
8380,3,Nice üëç product at this prize battery is amazing but display quality is as compair to other mi phone not God but nice at this prize range
8381,5,"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good."
8382,4,Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone
8383,5,1. Notifications LED is not available. 2. Double tapping screen lock feature is not available from home screen. (Only screen on/off is available when screen is lock)
8384,5,Very nice and photo clarity super battery power good
8385,4,"WRITING A REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS USAGE Camera : IT IS OKAY TYPE BATTERY:ON NORMAL USE(6-7 hrs) it lasts about 1 day DISPLAY: NO PROBLEMS TILL NOW,So Far so good VALUE FOR MONEY:ü§îWorth it definitely üëçüèª  PERFORMANCE: GOOD,  IF PERFORMANCE IS A CRITERIA For you THEN YOU CAN GO FOR 6GB VARIANT(I HAD BOUGHT 4 64)  A GOOD IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR YOUR PARENTS,but go for 6 GB it is better in long term usage.Happy buying!  ALSO IN AN LITTLE BUDGET YOU CAN BUY REALME NARZO 30 4G(DO CHECK IT)üëçüèª"
8386,3,Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item. Thanks.
8387,4,Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it
8388,5,Under 10k I think this is one of the most powerful phone. The camera works decently and takes clear crisp photos. It easily goes for a day with high usage and 2_3 days with minimum use. The display is large and sharp for watching videos. Performance wise it provides smooth actions.
8389,5,It's a good phone for normal users.  I used redmi note 4 for last 4 years but redmi 9 power is not as fast as note 4.  After taking picture in camera preview pic is blur for one second then become clear image.  Battery is really fantastic  Camera is good in daylight and low light not so good.  Sound is loud enough.  Network signal strength is not good.
8390,3,It's a really a good value for money the best part about this phone is its battery backup but the charger is too slow to charge the phone as its only 22watts but the phone only support 18watts but the performance wise it's good but if you play heavy games more than an hour then you might see some frame drops But after the update the problem is solved
8391,3,Best Price This year best battery back up mobile Very fast delivery flipkart Stereo speakersüîä superb Full HD screen awesome.. Totally nice.. I like it
8392,5,"Very fast delivery from Flipkart. Thanks. Redmi 9 Power has very powerful batteryüîã backup. Must buy, who want longer battery backup. Worth buy mobile in this price segment."
8393,5,Nice phone in correct price.. U should also try this phone Good quality of display and battery but something is missing like front flashlight
8394,3,.It has a good battery life . .Once fully charged if you are a normal user It will easily last for 1 and half day .Display is OK. It's not having much brightness when we put it on full brightness. .Because of 18 w fast charging it charges within 2 hr 15 min Front camera is not that much good. 48 MP main camera is good .I just used it for 1 week
8395,5,"If you need a good battery backup for 2 days it's a Excellent device having good processor, but if you are a Music Lover need good high pitch and volume you will be upset. Brightness in sun is also low."
8396,5,"Honest review after a month  Sound quality just amazing Display is really good at such price point Battery backup cames for a complete day even at heavy usage Gaming experience not upto the mark as I found many frame drops but you can play BGMI at low settings, always keep in mind it's not an gaming device Looks and design just steal the heart, wonderful  Under such price sigment  Overall for daily usage it's really amazing device"

8398,5,Fiery red colour is excellent Battery backup is also very good Camera quality is best Phone was slim and light weight Value for money
8399,4,Performance is very good and battery is quickly charging and this battery is available upto 24 hours only and camera performance is not equal to 48mega pixel. If you want to good camera please don't buy this mobile. This mobile is very weight for me. Display is good.
8400,5,"It's a decent phone I'm writing this review after the 2 days of use. Everything is good. When I ordered I was slightly concerned about the big branding at the back side but after putting the case on ( which was inside the box) it looks good and the branding doesn't feel like it's there. I don't play games so can't say much about gaming experience, but in regular uses this is really smooth. No ads till now. I think it is best at this price point."
8401,5,"Nice budget phone, camera is pretty good and battery is main attraction in this phone, display is very good. Totally a good phone under this price range"
8402,3,"Its quite good, but camera has got quite sharpness, battery is good, display is like ok, well overall gives good performance with good chipset."

8406,4,Good but front camera is not good but phone is best all things are suberb only front camera ..
8407,5,"It is a very good phone with good features at this price point. The camera is good for this price point, processor is also good, and battery is superb. This phone is made for the daily normal usage and not very heavy games and the phone works very smooth with normal and daily use."
8408,5,"This phone is good for this budget. Phone back camera are quite good but front camera I give 6 out of 10. The process is great but battery backup are same as like 5000 mph. So, if your are 10k I will recommend this phone‚ù§Ô∏è"

8410,3,Nice mobile at this price point. Surprisingly it comes with IR blaster and the mobile is water proof and also have stereo speaker. Snapdragon 662 is a decent processor with decent gaming performance. Anyway uts a nice mobile at this price.
8411,4,I'm satisfied with this mobile..actually i am first time using mi ui I'm fan of stok android but this is pretty good worth it
8412,5,Only issue is there is no charging indicator LED. Nor there is notifications indicating LED on phone. Rest all is amazing. This is my first week of use. I will post again my review after a month or so.  Overall it's a good deal at this price. Looks promising and premium phone overall.

8990,5,I was using redmi note 5 before i buy redmi 9 power. The quality of camera is not upto mark. I felt even some lower priced and previous versions of redmi gives better camera output. The light from flashlight is lesser than note 5. Power of wifi receiver is very less and i find difficulty in receiving signal when i am not so close to the wifi modem. Even my 2016 model phone picks wifi signals better than redmi power.

9019,1,Value off money üí∞ Best performance
9020,4,Very very bad camera
9021,5,Mobile hanging issue
9022,5,Nice product
9023,5,At this price range there are many other(mobile) option are available. Camera 48 mega pixel is just to highlight the customer. It gives the quality as 8 mega pixel. Brightness level is also very low in daylight even after it is full. Battery is Ok but to full charge it takes almost 2 hours 45 minutes.
9024,4,Please don't exchange Mobile on Flipkart they are cheat us
9025,3,After 20 days mobile got hangout
9026,5,Nice product Camera & battery is very good
9027,2,After using this phone I got battery drainage problems I'd comparatively fast . Camera is not good screen is overall good
9028,4,value for money only. if u are looking for avg phone with average speed having 4GB doesn't make any sense. performance is average. Camera quality is worst. If you are looking for a good camera then this choice would be incorrect.
9029,5,The 9 power is amazing budget mobile without compromising necessary features. Battery capacity is the most important one ( stands for 2 days for normal usage ) . UI is also good if you disable the bloatware during initial setup process. Can handle all the daily tasks for a typical user and there is no lag during usage
9030,5,Delivered in just 2 days. Good looking. ‚ú® Better battery backup. Faster. Worth the moneyüëå Sd processor is worth with lesser phone heat. Perfect pick for homemaker womanüë©
9031,5,Excellent product and awesome performance very use ful must by it
9032,1,Every phone will have same features but I love Motorola because of its gestures ‚ù§Ô∏è. It hasgood battery It has decent camera It has good processing speed and smooth running Only thing is it has plastic body...
9033,1,Loved the Color Good Finish It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned. Display is very dull Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing Cam is great for this price point Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera 128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization.. 90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.
9034,5,Camer performance is ok not that wow and not that bad in this budget range good performance. Battery life is also ok if use in battery saver mode battery will.work better All over good phone in range need to work but on camera and battery
9035,4,Mobile is very good and performance I gifted my sister on her birthday She is very happy thank u moto and also thank u Flipkart
9036,5,"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo..."
9037,1,Super ... Duper camera very very Excellent handset I love Moto g30 . Low money products very happy products. I am proud of you this is a nice products.üòÉüòÉüòÉ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
9038,3,Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot. Camera: Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.  Display: If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...
9039,5,Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.
9040,3,This thing has all the acquired characteristics of Moto G family except weight. Based on my experiences with Moto G3 and X Play devices this could be a bit more simpler in matters of usability. It is appreciated even though this bulky and heavier design is an R&D deviation with higher focus on Camera and Graphics. Camera is good in capturing details. NFC as well as sensors used are at par with the pricing. Live caption too works fine. Feels nothing bad for usual graphic apps but battery drain...
9041,1,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...
9042,1,Best Product According to price in every aspect. I have trust on Moto because I was using Moto G5S Plus till now(used for 3+ years). Love the software experience Moto provides. Would love to see more options from Moto in 15-20k and 20-25k.
9043,5,One of my favourite brand... N love to see it's coming up with better features every time ... Specially needed this kind of features in budget oriented phones... Loved it..

9045,2,"Overall very nice phone with all the latest feature such as android 11. Three finger screen shot , recorder and etc .battery back up is very good big display compared to other phones .camera is also good. Would recommend to buy this phone because its a budget phone with all feature."
9046,5,Device looks very promising and the performance is kind of okay. I was hoping with update they might push carrier aggregation (4G+) which really in this device. I like the 90Hz refresh rate and 20w turbocharger.
9047,5,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
9048,5,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."
9049,5,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.
9050,3,"A Great phone to gift your parents or guardians as they don't do much with the phone Camera, good features and compact phone, the Camera could have been better !!! Great battery backup upto 2days on moderate to heavy useage. Smooth Android Experience,"
9051,4,"Best üëç for who want a stock android phone lovers.., value for money üí∞ I love this one.., Everything is cool and clean I like the software. Best software experience and finest finishing The only thing I don't like is the phone felt like little weight.., And is it really 64megapixel üòÜ anyway Its a good stock android budget phone..,  Suggestion-- do not buy if u don't like stock android software..,"
9052,5,"A Budget Champ from Motorola. In first impression I've seen lots of new addition of customisation in stock android. New camera interface, UI customize tool, battery charging options, and lots more. My virdict are as follows Pros : 1. Nice 720P display 2. 5000 mah battery with 20w turbo adapter 3. 4/64 GB - 48 GB available for use 4. Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 - Adreno 610 5. Stock android with Android 11 out of the box Cons : 1.

9053,4,"Yes, the camera is not the best, the screen could have had some fine tuning, but the fact is, this is a no nonsense phone for the average Joe. I'm happy! Ratings: Design: 4 (The phone rarely looks like it does in the pictures above, more often than not, purple and even shades of green under inflorescent bulbs! But it's still classy.) Camera: 3 (It's there!) Performence: 4 (minor stutters occasionally, nothing worrying) Display: 3.5 (nothing a software update couldn't fix)) Ergonomics: 3 ( the..."
9054,5,"To be honest, didn't have much expectation with the mid-ranger but I was amazed at how well it is suited for day-to-day work.  I just wanted a clean UI, quick and responsive phone. (I upgraded from SD435) The moto glass is lightyears better than a notification light.  Moto's little tweaks are way too awesome."
9055,2,"Moto g30 is a superb phone and value for money. The clean android experience with good signal strength, thanks to 2x2 mimo technology, and call clarity. The display and features are really good. In fact I got fed up with my samsung A70S which I bought 1 year ago. So was doubting about the display because I am used to super amoled screen. But my overall experience with motog30 is completely satisfactory. Thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone in 24hrs."
9056,3,A very good budget oriented phone. Camera is adequate for an average user . A battery which lasts almost 2 days( average use) Big in size which is good for gamers and multimedia users . Clean stock Android experience and guaranteed security updates.

9058,2,"Moto G30 is overall a budgeted smart phone. Its camera is lagging for 1-2 seconds when u click pic. Also it doesn't have a auto adjustment brightness feature. I had read in other people's comments that display is not upto the mark, but i felt display is nice and smooth. Finishing is awesome and mobile didn't feel heavy also. One can go for it rather than going in MI or realme having short life span."
9059,5,"Camera is not as expected eventhough it's not an issue, battery life is good, complete day I used whatsapp and 4g browsing it's taken only 35 percent so battery optimization is very good. And call quality is decent level. User interface is slightly difference from others, even it's hd+ display, it's better including outdoor and nice refresh rate as I am using only auto mode.

9062,5,"I am impressed with it's Stock android UI and features. Camra and is better than average. It can shoot like 32 MP flagship camera. Display quality is average. Camera app is little bit lagging I hope it will be improved by app updates. But MOTO can improve your some features.ie 1. Add convert in their CALCULATOR. 2. Record voice of video in SCREEN RECORDING. 3. Give app lock in SECURITY SETTING. 4. Give feature to adding other video, audio and photo in the middle of video in VIDEO EDITOR"
9063,5,"You can not get the phone flip cover easily, packings was wast even first time I have seen that ther was not bubbles rap on phone,looks like that packing was totally mess..phone performance is cute good however you will get the more Phone in less price.."
9064,4,Using Moto for 6+ yrs. Ideal for normal users at this budget with clean UI. Same model with 6 GB RAM variant could have made this much better option to choose compare to other brands.
9065,5,"Pros: Best part is the stock android. Performance is good. Camera qualoty os also satisfactory with the price given, doesn't look truly 64MP camera though but with the price of the phone , no complaints.  Cons: Phone batyery is not so good. Charging is slow and power back is not good as well. Pocks up heat sometimes. Its bulky, did not have this expectation from moto. Screen clarity also not so great.  Expected better product from moto."

9067,5,"I love moto phones by its gestures and it's more than average tough body than other smartphones. This time I purchased moto again because of its good quality plus fast charging and no bloatware (Bloatware is commercial software that is preinstalled on a device by the manufacturer, whether it's useful or not, and tends to waste memory and resources. While some of these apps may be useful, the majority of them simply sit there taking up storage space and in some cases, affecting the performance..."
9068,5,"Very good Phone for gifting to elders, because of super clean software with no spoofs, a very long lasting battery and super fast and responsive display. Excellent for doing everyday tasks. Not so good for performance tasks,or for camera folks"
9069,4,Don't expect much. Camera is good in outdoor but struggle in low light. Battery is good enough for one full day. Performance is above average. It is a value for money product. Far better than '12' in similar price range.
9070,4,"Superb battery life for office going persons and unique feature is that it gets charged up to 40-50 per cent in just 15-25 minutes. Camera quality is excellent only lag of focus white shooting videos. UI is pure no adds, no third party apps. Overall performance is good. I am writing this after using for more than 20 days."
9071,5,"Its a good phone for the price. Pros - 1- Excellent in hand feel and balanced weight distribution, phone feels so solid and amazing in hand!! 2- Display, even though 720p, still looks great and not pixelated and due to 90Hz it feels ultra smooth. 3- Loudspeaker is good, loud and clear, no distortion even at high volumes 4- Call quality is very good through earpiece and loudspeaker. 5- Performance is good.

9072,5,"One of the best budget smartphones available in the market. With the tough build quality and sleek design, this phone definitely stands out its competition. Camera is quite impressive for the price range, battery lasts for more than a day while data on, speakers are decent, performance wise- 4GB Ram and Snapdragon 662 work really well, however the display quality could have been better."
9073,4,"ROM AND RAM LESS Camera improved performance in both day and night Pictures looks more realistic Battery stays for 2and half days in battery saving mode for moderate use - calling, whatsapp, yutube songs, online search. Charger not as fast as Samsung charger."

9075,5,"I bought moto g30 and there are mainly 3 reasons not to buy it. A) 720p screen, like no one wants that.. But good enough for spare phone. B) There is no way to change SOS calling, on pressing the power button 3 times by mistake the phone will call the emergency helpline, mine does it once a day. Thanks moto. C) They have a secondary physical button which summons the Google assist, there is no way to remap it, it's totally useless. It's fine as a temporary phone or a backup phone, it can't be..."

9079,4,"Camera is average...If you are not the one who is camera centric then I think it would be desirable to buy moto g30. Display is dull compared to other smartphones in this range. Battery- It is giant and nobody can beat moto with respect to battery performance. Gesture add on is a unique feature of moto which is praiseworthy. No heating issues, long battery pack up and fastness of this phone is what attracted me most. Overall a good buy."
9080,2,"Everything is working all right, camera, UI, battery , fingerprint scanner is the fastest of all. The weight is evenly distributed over the entire phone it does not feel heavy at any specific point. This photo may not be clear but the real display is best with full colors."
9081,4,"G Non nonsense, decent product for the price, good built quality, value for money & obviously the stock Android experience is always the best with the Nokia or Motorola devices...would have been even better if Motorola had launched the 6-128gb version along with this"
9082,3,"Simply worthless device ( My device at least) . Every time it gets a bit more load , it hangs and stops working. Above that I think it has some issues over wifi connectivity . All the other devices at my home work flawlessly with my router , apart from this one. In this device I get "" No Internet "" quite often while using wifi , while other devices are working fine . And there is no inbuilt app locker or something like that . My previous Redmi 5a with only 3 gb of ram was better than this."
9083,4,Everything is perfect except battery. I really love all the features. I recommend these phone to all. Battery Capacity is not good from my exceptation.

9088,4,"After a two months of use, it's totally value for money. Of course it's not a perfect gaming phone but it handles COD, BGMI etc., types of heavy games smoothly. For a multi tasking person it's a perfect budget hero. And the little touches of MOTO Experience apps gives you more satisfaction for it.  Camera: it's not a premium grade but it does fairly it's job.  Ram management is good.  Cons: Hybrid sim slot Display could be a bit better."
9089,5,"Camera and battery are good. Good charging speeds. Been using it for 3 months. camera can be made better with software upgrades (but it does the job). No bloatwares,clean UI, pure stock experience."
9090,3,"It's really an underrated phone maybe because of its display. Overall the stock android combined with Moto mods give a clean and friendly software experience. The cameras are really good,they provide true to nature colours. One of the most interesting feature is NFC though many people don't use it but it's really great to get it in this price range.

Disadvantage is hybrid sim slot."

Previously I was using MotoG5s+ which had almost a complete day battery power even after 3 yrs of use, but this device hardly survive for 12hrs. 2. Slow charging. Since Motorola is providing Turbocharger, but I don't know why it takes about 4 hrs to charge fully, and discharge within 7-10 hrs. 3. Camera quality. So many functions are there for camera, but they are useless if resolution and dpi is ..."

9186,5,"Camera quality is okay but pics/vids occupy more space than expected as per the quality of photos.It provides no gallery of its own that's very annoying.Overall phone is less customisable. 64GB for 11k is really expensive, out of which only 48Gb is usable, it isn't Value for Money tbh."

It has a 64MP AI quad camera which captures the worst quality pictures and it is literally slower in performance and hangs quite a lot.

9218,5,"The phone is very bad in all aspects . To start with.  1. Camera : The cameras both front and Back are very bad , blurred and low light and no clarity. They never had proper colors. other brand phones in the price range are very good 2. Poor display and bad colors. 3. No proper Battery back up  4.

Worst part is I exchanged by Moto e5 power which was working perfectly well for this piece of trashü§¶ Terrible display and new user interface. Just not comfortable using it even after 2 months. Please please please do not buy this. Humble request üôè Moto should sell their old models instead of this."

As soon as you click record it loudly say 'the call is been recorded' except that everything is fine. Camera is good, display is HD+ hardly you will notice any difference.

9229,4,"I purchased it for my mother. The comparison was with Narzo20A and redmi 9 prime. But, i choose this one, because it gives clean android. People said, the camera is not good, but I don't find any issues. Charging time more but it also gives good backup. My mother runs it for 2 whole days. Performance is also good. Design is good. Fingerprint sensor can be faster but it runs for parent. Overall, good value for money."

9433,5,Moto E7 Plus is a third class quality phone. Front Camera is very very very Poor. While on a call many other apps get open automatically.

Full value for money. 50% Battery stands upto 8 hours of YouTube usage (I would recharge when it comes 50% battery). So with internet usage it will come upto 16 hours or more. Without internet usage it took 15% of battery for 24 hours. So obviously it will come upto nearly 7 days for full charge. At my point of view only one draw back that is camera quality they told that camera has 48MP but it i...

It is very bad that in today's generation mobile having no other seperate slot for memory card. It is big disadvantage to have only option of one sim and one memory card or two sim card no memory card. Secondly camera quality is bad. Image quality is not like 48 MP. Design is not very good...

11285,5,Although the stock android experience is amazing it is to be noted that the reception on the phone is very weak given the fact that other phones give much superior results with the same sim.  A big flaw since that's the prime goal of a cell phone.

11362,3,The phone is good in this price. Camera :- they are saying 48+2mp camera but the camera is really very bad . Battery :- battery life is quit good but the charger is very poor quality it feels like keypad phones charger. Display :- display is not that smooth but it's good in this price. Looks :- the overall look of the phone is really good you can't tell the price by it's looks . Overall :- the product is really good but I'm not going to say excellent and I'll update if I like or dislike ...

11678,4,"Don't believe on YouTube reviews, I'm using this mobile and it's a good phone. If you are looking for a mobile phone for your parents then this can be an excellent choice. It's fast, bloatware free and you can do little bit of gaming with low to medium settings. Battery backup is excellent more than 2 days but charging could have been better. I got a good deal with exchanging a old mobile phone. So I'm happy with this purchase. Not recommended for hardcore gamers or camera lovers, a big NO."

12151,3,With Moto E7 plus you will get the Value for money and a strong belief of Motorola as there has been no complaints on Moto devices since I had one for my mother before this so I opt for Moto again without thinking of anything for her this time.

But for call and video watching and social networking it's doing well. Can't handel heavy games like COD but doing great for candy crush and angry bird. Now upto u. For minimal gaming it's good .

Just Ok - When taking photos after clicks using finger print sensor the photos not captured. Actually this is very common and existing feature for old and new model android mobiles. But still moto not updated in these type of common features ..need to update these feature. - When taking photos capturing is too slow...this problem is occurred smart phone initial releases .....
12529,4,Network captured power is low.very disappointed me.

As per the Flipkart terms & condition the maximum value Rs 2,150 & minimum value Rs 950. I am not having any problems & damage of my mobile phone. They are doing presure on us the mobile is damaged we cannot find any fault in it This is totally cheating with us."
12546,2,"Phone is Good, but please don't buy mobile from Flipkart and i really had a very bad experience with Flipkart delivery and exchange of my old phone. Though my old phone is perfectly fine they did reduced the exchange value. I never expected such a low class approach from a highly valued ecommerce site like Flipkart. AVOID buying from Flipkart."

12586,5,"Camera is not of 48Mp totally cheated by manufacturer. Phone is for average use, Screen is long, battery backup is average is not up to 5000mah, camera resolution is 48 mexa pixel is totally rubbish. Earlier Moto camera of 8MP is far better than48 MP, screen touches is average. Manufacturer are cheating consumer on 48 MP camera there is no any quality check. Think before to buy it is better to purchase from market. They shows demo of every items."

12618,5,Phone is good but nowadays phone screens are too big. We can call phones tablet lite version. Not handy Night vision camera is too good. But day light images are ok ok. Rest all is good but little bit heavy. I request motorola to make handy phone because moto phones are too heavy and strong plus big screens make the phone little bit unhandy....

12635,4,Best pure Android mobile under 10k (I bought it for 8100) without any add or unnecessary apps. Super camera. Overall good. Only one thing is low power charger. Better to buy higher power charger to charge quickly.

Though it's good.  Camera: set the camera manually and the results are amazing. Slow motion videos are pretty good. Also Selfie camera is impressive.  Other features: Motorola has given there one of the best phone in this price range. I have been using it now for more than 20 days and I am impressed. It have notificatio...
12643,2,Best phone in this price
12644,5,"Best budget phone, but face unlock is not good. Every morning it shows to unlock the phone through pin, pattern, password"
12645,5,Best budget phone in this price
12646,5,Moto's credibility for its build quality is degraded with this device as it's screen cracked at top right corner and with few week of usage there is lots of scratches visible without protection screen. Battery life is also quite poor even with 5000mah battery. Screen display is usable and device performance and camera is good considering the price segment.

Quality of camera is not this much satisfied. 13MP of e4 plus is much more good from this one. Same for battery backup. In both mobile battery is 5000 MAH. But backup in very much good in e4 plus. My suggestion is, if you are planning for buy this one than I recommend you should go with moto e4 plus not with e7 plus."

Go for realme...my old realme 3i gives better picture quality than this mobile.. I bought realme 3i again after using this Camera was utter flop... Worst 48 MP ever.. output is 12 MP.. even if ...it is worst.. it says 4gb ram but hardly performs like 3 or 2 gb only dont buy for camera/ram.. buy for clean android that at 6k range ....
12777,2,Very good product
12778,5,"Awesome mobile and good looking this mobile value of many, good delivery thanks to Flipkart"
12779,5,Graphics is not upto the mark. Camera is ok and little above average even 48MP also.Having trouble in data connectivity.even though it is having higher band configuration.touch sensitivity is not satisfied. Felt little slow .  Battery and sound in good for this price. Have to accept the fact it is a low budget mobile. Even though the configuration and performance not met as they mentioned.7k is ok price for this one
12780,5,Overall superb mobile at this price
12781,5,Camera will disappoint you.. images are soft and not sharp for both rear and selfie cam.. night vision is also okayish.. 48 MP is only for attracting the customers to buy it

12804,4,Front camera quality was not that much good quality.. Over all ok for the money.
12805,5,Everything is good under this price range except for the USB type B port. It does NOT have USB type C. And doesn't have turbocharger included. Has a basic charger.
12806,5,"Overall good phone for it's price range, Motorola is trustworthy brand , and more importantly this phone is made in India, that is biggest plus point. It may show little glitches sometimes. I also needed to change that gesture navigation feature, it makes phone painful to use, You can change to three button navigation from settings. To add back button go to settings>system> gestures>system navigation>3 button navigation. It will solve your problem."

12824,5,"Don't buy this phone, in this phone brightness is very low quality, front camera is very poor. Battery backup is also of poor quality."
12825,5,Ok Ok
12826,5,Nice phone...
12827,5,Well I have been using this phone for quite a time now and i can tell that it is the best non-chinese smartphone in its range .The battery backup is working incredibly and till now the 10W charging is also not much of a trouble haven't tried 0-100 but it did charge the phone from 47 to 89 in 22 minutes which is finely appropriate.The performance is incredible but it does take some mere seconds for loading the apps after you restart the phone but again watching the price range its fine.Talking...
12828,5,I hate network speed this phone give some updates
12829,1,Good products üëç
12830,5,"Super, Value for money.."
12831,5,Most mind choice mobile
12832,5,Stock android no bloatwares and a decent camera. All in all a good buy.
12833,3,Great product for this price tag!
12834,5,Good in price
12835,5,Budget king
12836,4,"Camera Quality is not so good, I'm using Moto One Power currently with 16MP rear camera but Moto One Power camera is too good in comparison to 48MP of MOTO E7 PLUS."
12837,5,"So I brought this one in Big Billion Day sale and: PROS: 1. Smooth texture experience. 2. Playing media quality is great. 3. Calling quality is good too. CONS: 1. Battery backup quality has started deteriorating in just a few days. 2. Forget heavy gaming, cannot even handle moving big files or any other heavy RAM use activity. 3. Camera quality is too poor for a 48 MP camera. 4. Allows only 2 sims (without SD card) or a sim and a sd card. Doesn't have 3 slots for idk what reason."
12838,5,Awesome product
12839,5,do not buy completely waste this product
12840,5,Just awesome
12841,1,It is amazing mobile
12842,5,Nice but company should provide earphones also
12843,5,Alike professional
12844,5,Look wise very smart phone i give 5 star
12845,1,"Everything is good at affordable price. Two drawbacks as per my observation. 1. We can't able to insert 2 sims and memory card at a time, either we can use 1 sim and 1 memory card or 2 sims only. 2. In setting there is short cut option for mobile data changeover and all. Next SMS can be sent only with a single sim, if we need choose sending sms it need to he modified in setting only. 3. Screen looking dull but there is no strain for eyes, comfort feel is there."
12846,5,It's a perfect product for elderly use. It can't be used for heavy usage but it's perfect for daily use considering the usage and price it's probably a good option. If you need it for basic use and not for gaming and all go for it but it can't handle heavy usage.

14513,3,"Looks sleek, very comfortable to wear and yet to test it out for accuracy during walking or cycling my two main exercises but I feel it's a purchase which will be very satisfactory.  After using the watch for a while I can assure you its a brilliant product and has very good accuracy when it comes to covering step counts, calories burnt as well as heart rate. Sleep tracking is very good too and the fitbit app is excellent."
14514,5,"fitbit versa is looking absolutely great !!! No doubt at all.All features are good but payments were not supported for Indian version, hoping to get payment option soon. Best product at its cost range."
14515,1,I wasn't a great fan of activity monitors but the one thing that interested me to go for fitbit versa is i can load lots of songs and can go for my daily jogging with out needing to carry my phone. I connect my wireless ear buds with out any hassle. I'm not a fitness freak but once I got used to the activity monitor the data is helping me to be more active in the day. the fun part for me is to try hundreds of different free watch faces that suit to your taste. does everything that's mentione...
14516,5,Great product for the amount paid. Got it for 7999. Its amazing and works very well. It can even measure oxygen level. Thank you for such an amazing product.
14517,2,watch is really good....i found very useful to track my activity....quality and built great for this price point...suggest to buy the watch below 15k whenever there is any offer....because then the value for money could be felt satisfactory
14518,5,Excellent product. Worth buying it. I personally suggest not to go for higher version for beginners who are planning to buy a smart watch. Apart from other cheap brands and entry level smart watches Fitbit Special Edition is best in looks and performance as well.
14519,5,"Overall a good product as it looks and feels good on my wrist.  Pros 1. Looks good and stylish 2. Has plenty of apps that can be downloaded using the mobile app 3. Vibration with notification is very strong  Cons 1. Syncing with the app takes a while sometimes 2. I was not able to transfer music to the built in music app even when the watch was connected to a wifi 3. Even riding a scooter counts as steps, which is ridiculous"
14520,5,"Great value at this price point, though I was expecting little more battery power along with few basic features like spo2, stress meter etc which are missing.  The music section required a paid version of Spotify and again the watch won't itself play. Ut you would need to carry your phone along with watch with paid version of Spotify to just manage the control. I personally don't find this useful because if I have to carry the phone than I can mange the control from my phone of bluetooth ear..."
14521,5,I ordered the peach color watch and it looks great the watch is rose gold and strap is peach colored. looks great on wrist and has good features.. setting up and configuring was smooth. Till now no issues per se. Delivery was fast and without glitch. Product was also defect free.
14522,4,not worth for money... couldn't able to get music /songs as specified.. no synch established for whattups.. calendar after all attempts post spending good time.. not worth to buy...
14523,4,"i am using this watch more than one month watch is good really helpful for those who are health consious . watch is looking perfect , heart rate sensor is also fine , tracking is also gud but one thing i feel about this is its screen .it is so small we are habitual of large screen and this watch has little screen u think fitbit should work on this ..and it straps and screen gurads also so expensive"
14524,5,I would have liked to give a 3.5 stars but there's no option here! okay so now the watch:- The watch is grt in terms of fitness related features like tracking and stuff!! my main use of the watch was to use it like an smartwatch. it works like half smartwatch at the most that i can say! Though it has great features the main problem that i faced was while connecting it to my phone (honor play) it frequently drops the Bluetooth connection every now and then!
14525,2,very beautiful smart watch.. and works perfectly..... this is my third Fitbit in family and from last 5 years we have been a part of Fitbit family..... no complain....I don't see the point of wasting so much money on apple watch when the same work is done and beside you won't need a apple cellphone to sync it is compatible with any operating system...... value for money..... only first syncing one feel takes 5 min rest it just glided
14526,5,"This is a very good watch I am giving this review after using it for one week, it looks nice display is good data I felt the data is pretty accurate. I got it during the sale and the price which I got it was worth taking it, however I was not sure that this watch is not compatible with all the devices. Before buying this watch I would recommend that you go to the website of fit bit and find the list of compatible device for Versa and then only buy it. No wonder thatYou may have to buy a phone..."
14527,2,I will divide this in pros and cons. Pros : 1. Screen brighten is good. 2. All the values shown by watch is appropriate. 3. Extra straps were good. 4 . Overall give you feeling of very premium watch. 5. I got it for 7500 so price is excellent. Cons: 1. Battery backup is not that much good (3 days).
14528,5,"Surprised to get delivery from Flipkart within 2 days. Thanks Flipkart.. Really a good quality product from fitbit with accuracy in each function. Easy to operate OS, Crisp and clean display along more functions for a fitness lover makes this product a worth buy."
14529,3,PLZZ read this before Wasting your money. PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Flipkart. They are not ready for return process even if your product is worst. Flipkart is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy headache and problems then go there. Don't waste your time with Flipkart  Regarding Fitbit Versa Performance is very worst. Which is atomatically disconnected from the app and then act as a simple digital watch. Flipkart customer care to take thi...
14530,5,"My wife wanted a smart watch which could guess the hours of deep sleep and also count her exercise minutes, she does different HIIT forms. I was a bit skeptical before buying it but she ABSOLUTELY loved it. This was an anniversary gift and i still hear of it."
14531,5,Every day I am falling in love with this versa... only concern is battery it doesn‚Äôt lasts more than 3 days.
14532,5,wonderful product
14533,4,Used it for 4 days now its time to tell the pros n cons.Step counter is absolute fail. I had to ride 23km to work and it counted 2300 steps along with stats of climbing 29 floors which was hilarous. heart sensor works good. vibration is adeqaute to notify calls ans other notifications. dial size is too small those who are big guns consider trying it out on retail shops before buying it.. Wallet app doesnt seems to be availabe in India so NFC payment feature you can forget it. The app sto...
14534,5,awesome.
14535,5,I had ordered 2 watches but returned both of them. This watch is good but FitBit android application is very bad no proper syncing and had a lots of problems with notifications. If someone is purchasing smartwatch then without notification and proper syncing its just a digital watch why will someone waste so much money on a stupid digital watch.
14536,4,Just don't waste your money on this idiotic product..it will make your life hell cos it will stop notifying you time and again..and only option to resolve it is reinstalling the app..you will end up doing it 3-4 times a day..bad just bad.
14537,4,FitBit Stopped Working after 6 months of use. Doesnt connect to IOS or Android. Tried everything. Wasted all my investment on this watch!!
14538,5,Worth the price... does all it claims to do...and does it well
14539,3,good
14540,4,"Yes, it is the best fitness tracker watch. Data is accurate. Yes GPS is missed, but you can carry your cell phone along while running or jogging. The tracker and App does get the job done. Display as they say is amazing, no matter how sunny is the light outside, you can view your info. People who want to track their fitness goal, I would suggest go for it."
14541,4,Nice product nice batter life colour quality is very poor but Look's primium....
14542,5,steps are not accurate ..may be you have to half fold the count
14543,4,Wow great one i loved it totally
14544,5,The fitbit is good. A price around 6k would be better for this I think. although I do not think spo2 sensor is there in the device. The description is wrong.  Not a right practice to advertise something which is not there in the product. Should be changed or fix the product.
14545,4,Good to go watch . Quite light Weight
14546,1,"It is indeed an amazing fitness watch considering the price and all the features offered with it. And the extra straps are really useful, I had to buy aftermarket straps for my blaze after 2 years of use, but with the versa SE you will get total 3pare of strap including the one allready installed. And decent delivery by flipkart."
14547,5,Great watch to wear üëå
14548,4,1. U can listen to music through your Bluetooth headset 2. Takes approximately 30min to setup on wifi 3. Connect same wifi with phone and watch 4. For music upload in watch u have to download app in your laptop and select transfer music option in watch and wait to connect .Then just simply drag and drop songs and sync with watch 5. U have to take ur mobile while running because it has connected gps 6. U cant connect ur Bluetooth headset and watch together in Vivo z1pro 7. U have to on ur m...

14552,1,they gave used product
14553,1,it's good.
14554,1,nice smartwatch..
14555,4,"Got it for 10,999 rs. Major problem with this is ""notification"" it never showed notification on my oneplus 6 phone. Highly disappointed!! rest everything is fine"
14556,5,"Changing opinion from 4 star to 1 star. After using it for one year, it stopped counting step, heartbeat & motion sensor stopped working, contacted it's CC they told me to factory reset it & again do setup, after doing the same for 10 time no change occurred, now watch is not starting & charging, after contacting they told me that your warranty is over & they suggest me to buy a new one, never expected such poor quality from world famous fitbit."
14557,5,"First it's not functioning properly. To be particular, i don't get notifications on phone properly. Two when I compare them with the watch which my friend purchased in US. It looks like replica. There is been alot of variance in quality."
14558,4,"the Bluetooth is very poor, synchronization gets disconnected very frequently, step count is also inccurate, app is very confusing, waisted my money, this is my last purchase from Fitbit"
14559,3,Good Product
14560,5,Amazing product but prize is very high. Coming to performance is above average Overall product is good ‚ò∫Ô∏è
14561,4,Nice product
14562,5,The connected phone notifications rarely work on this watch. Cannot see the messages nor the incoming calls. I have seen similar issue with charge 2. Tried every possible troubleshooting option suggested but couldn't resolve it.
14563,5,Writing this review after using the product for 9 months . The watch used to work almost satisfactorily for most of the period but there was some noticeable glitch in tracking the heart rate on many occasions . After 09 months it's recording of heart rate became completely erratic . It is abnormally high even during sleep . This error has made the watch completely useless as all the vital stats and features are dependent on accurate tracking of heart rate only .
14564,4,"The Versa 1st Generation is still a great bet for those wanting in on the Fitbit ecosystem. It's a no - gimmicks, no - frills smartwatch that does the job well. I got it at a great price during the Flipkart sale."
14565,4,Not supporting for Notifications.
14566,2,Device looks and feels good. It functions well.  But...  Does not pair well with MI A3 device. Please make sure that you check their website for the list of phones that it can sync up well.
14567,5,Good product without any questions. Free apps are available up to date.
14568,1,Really liked this watch ‚ò∫Ô∏è
14569,1,nice watch but have issues with bluetooth connectivity. but still overall one can have it as a beginner.
14570,4,very pathetic watch only after two weeks of use its now showing blank screen and above all no service centre in India
14571,5,first check your mobile compatibility before purchasing one..Redmi not 5 Pro not compatible
14572,4,Happy to buy it in billion sale
14573,1,Awesome Smart Watch At This Budgets 4 Day's Battery Backup Thankyou Filpkart..!
14574,1,not support all mobile model
14575,1,Do not buy...not worth and they fool us saying no refund..warning in 1week watch glass will break if it thouch any wall or drop..for this cost and brand they should have improved the quality and more functions. so please don't buy and get fooled
14576,4,Don't ever buy fitbit watch'. If anything happens after one year they will say that as it is out of warranty so nothing can be done. You may buy if you can invest such a huge amount for one year. My watch is not getting connected with any mobile phone means i thing bluetooth is not working. Its better to buy some other watch which is not so costly. On help they says nothing can be done as it is not getting connected.
14577,3,this fitbit versa is awesome... i am using this snartwatch from last 15 days and I loved it... all functions are very good and accurate... only problem I had in the beginning while connecting with phone but now it is part of my daily routine...
14578,5,Got it at an amazing deal for 7.5k during big billion days. Thank you Flipkart.
14579,3,"Awesome product, fully satisfied..great product team fitbit.üëåüôè"
14580,3,It's a good watch.
14581,5,After one year use display was damaged.
14582,1,Device could not pair by blue tooth with smart phone
14583,4,Very inaccurate and unreliable

14585,4,Full features for this cost is value for money
14586,4,Not good start problem ha
14587,1,Value for money. Good product
14588,3,Ok
14589,4,"The activity tracking is good. But the watch's battery is terrible and barely lasts 2 days. Also, the mechanism to remove and attach the straps is the worst."
14590,5,Battery melted in 2 month time and not getting any support from any where.. flipkart customer support is just waste.. they promise to call in some time but never turned up.. facing issue from 1 month but no prevail. Dont purchase any item like that frm flipkart.
14591,1,Just premium awesome
14592,1,Worst quality of Band...... And accessories not available in local market..... I waste my money after 1 month of use..
14593,2,Battery is draining fast
14594,4,Very good. No compromise on Fitbit quality. Good deal.
14595,5,Its not worth buying this watch...you will find wtches in 2-3k which does better job than this
14596,5,Value for money
14597,5,The quality of Fitbit Versa is not good and I am writing this after using the watch for 1.5 years of limited use.  1. The rubber wrist straps are of poor quality: Cracked after 3 months of usage.  2. Vibration stopped working after 1 year.  3. The accuracy is not that good. My phone's health app is much accurate than this watch.  4. Touch (screen) not very smooth
14598,2,I gifted this to my father on his birthday. He loved it. Its really good.
14599,2,The watch looks good. The connectivity is also pretty good. The designs looks cool too. The only down fall I noticed is that it tracks your step while you are riding bike aur driving car.
14600,2,Just okay
14601,5,Excellent watch.
14602,5,Amazing Amazing Amazing product But battery backup average
14603,2,Some functions not there in actual but was mentioned on product page. The charger seems to be old with whitish texture on top.
14604,5,Connectivity is very loose
14605,4,Good product
14606,3,Most useless product. Will never get connected to bluetooth. Pure waste of money. That's why flipcart is selling it with such discount. Just don't waste your money. Super useless watch
14607,1,Good product... resonable price...
14608,5,"Cool looks and good for technosavvy people!! Keeps records of heart rate, steps and many more, has bluetooth accessibility to all ur apps in the phone üìû. Displays all notifications and calls!!"
14609,1,"Once u lock ur device , and simultaneously unpair your device from mobile then u can never unlock that device for life time"
14610,3,Excellent Fitbit for the price If you are looking for your first smart watch it a best choice Battery lasts more than 3 days Display is great Accuracy is near to perfect My experience first update is done by calling customer care which is also in Fitbit app which Is of great easy I like the most is we can add our photos as watch face with all info such as time heart rate etc
14611,5,The display glass of the watch is not worth the money. I have been using various watches all through my life. Right from HMT to Fossil. But this is the first time I bought a watch that chipped at the edges with just a light tap against the door frame. I have now worn a silicon screen protector. Also the strap broke in two months. One good fact is I got 4straps with this watch. Will never buy Fitbit watches again. Plain health bands are good but not watches .
14612,3,Very bad product. Don't buy it.
14613,4,I can not fix silicone black strap to the dail. Their is no notifications on watch and i am facing problems because of this
14614,2,"A gr8 watch with best discounts from Flipkart and fast delivery. Fitbit is the most reputed name in smart watches with accurate heart rate, sleep & spo2 tracker."
14615,4,Very nice
14616,5,This watch was Awesome
14617,3,Truly outstanding except the battery. The looks is superb.
14618,5,Don't buy this product none of the feature is not working in this product and waste of money
14619,5,Worth buying it
14620,3,It is a good product in this price range.
14621,2,Facing issue with connectivity and notifications access on mobile.
14622,5,"The Fitbit is not getting charged at all since last 2 days. Earlier on 25th April also same issue was faced, when we kept it on the charger for few hours and after few hours it started charging. But since last 2 days it not getting charged at all. We tried various options like putting the usb charger in laptop and differ power points but no avail. The quality of the product sent is really questionable. Poor quality product has been sent by dealer."
14623,1,"Worst product to buy, waste of money. after all the attempt to fix the sync issue it failed to do so. Bought an expensive new phone just to be compatible but still facing the same issue."
14624,5,Pathetic smartwatch. Displays wrong distances. Too much error in all features. Don't buy. Waste of money
14625,5,It's an amazing product
14626,1,"The Fitbit distance calculation is wrong. Eg:: when I walk a particular distance it shows 1 km, but when you run the same distance it shows 1.4km meters."
14627,5,"The major con is the battery life. If I just wear this the entire day without syncing with phone, even then I need to charge it once in 2 days. The claim of 4 days battery life is total sham. Deducting 2 points for that alone. My older GoQii used to give me a good week's life.  The 2nd major pain in the neck was adding music to the watch. It took a software update for me to realise that I wasn't doing anything wrong, it was a glitch in existing software.  It does a pretty decent job of tracki..."
14628,3,With heartbeat on battery backup is 1+ days Spo2 doesn't work Steps count is not accurate.
14629,1,Poor battery backup
14630,2,Best watch
14631,5,This watch is so good.And I can where it anywhere.
14632,5,Awesome üòé thank you flipkart for service
14633,5,Worth buy and accurate
14634,5,"Except the average battery life of 3-4 days max... It's awesome. Transferring of songs is bit of a hassle as one can only do it thru laptop. Light weight, touch control responsive. Got it for 7999/-. Worth every penny."
14635,2,Bettery keep charging every day
14636,5,After one year display automatically damaged
14637,5,Excellent product... Useful features for a lay person to collect data
14638,3,Worst product no recommended
14639,1,Good watch...looks stylish...
14640,1,Beautiful watch...value for money.
14641,1,Used for about a week now and completely satisfied. Great look and good battery life.
14642,5,Good one
14643,2,"At this price , I could have purchased better product , worst UI"
14644,3,Okay product
14645,2,Thanks flipkart for ontime delivery. Product recieved as described in description. Will write a review after three months if use.
14646,2,The watch stopped working as on March 1st 2021. Never expected this in less than 1.5 years from date of purchase.  Not sure if Flipkart is selling low quality products or the watch itself has an issue.  Either way very disappointed
14647,5,Awsome experience....
14648,5,Good watch
14649,4,"Great smart watch. cool looks. battery life is okay-ish, around 3 days. would love to see SPO2 sensor getting used beyond just sleep data."
14650,5,Unable to reach customer care. The product is not even used for a week now the battery is getting drained in less than 12 hours.
14651,5,Not good
14652,2,Waste of buying
14653,2,Nice watch
14654,5,Very nice product...üëç
14655,1,All good on the accuracy front. Battery life could have been better though .
14656,4,Item is ok bt not supported some apps
14657,5,Its a good smart watch with all the necessary features. Highly Recommended
14658,5,Absolutely inaccurate in terms of distance. GPS connection is horrible. If you are looking for sports tracking then better choose Garmin or other chinese brands. Not satisfied with Fitbit's purchase. Wont recommend
14659,5,Very bad experience Connectivity is zero backup also poor
14660,1,Very nice smartwatch in low price!!!
14661,3,"Works great, got delivered on time. Step counter was inaccurate for a bit but nothing you can't fix. The battery lasts for 3-4 days on constant use without notifications. If you have notifications on then it will drain faster. You can't answer calls and texts on this but you do get notification, I personally don't find this feature very useful. Overall decent buy I'd say."
14662,5,All the other features are very good and they are as precise as promised by the brand. The only issue I think is the battery does not last not even for 2 whole days whereas I don't even wear it to my bed.
14663,1,"Incompatible with ios i guess.Sometimes it gets disconnected too. Even I‚Äôm using the latest verions,it shows up to update the app or watch OS to change the clock faces."
14664,5,Superb watch Lots of Clock faces Ok for Activity tracking 2day battery backup only
14665,5,Not good
14666,4,The watch is good. Has good functionality. Battery life is 4 days+. Delivery was fast.
14667,1,Good watch
14668,2,Don't buy.starts malfunctioning after 10 days
14669,1,Worth it....
14670,5,Waste.. it's getting hung all the time..not able to complete a workout..
14671,5,Nice
14672,4,Very nice watch in a quite reasonable price. Lots of features. Loving it. Working good.
14673,3,"Nothing can be better than this product , good deal on Flipkart , I will suggest to buy this product without any confusion"
14674,4,Good one if you donot mind connecting to gps of phone. Has 3-4 days of charge. Readings are fairly accurate.
14675,1,Good deal. Amazing! The package had 2 belts as mentioned. bought it at a good discount
14676,1,Great product!!
14677,5,Not value for money..
14678,5,Nice watch
14679,4,Amazing
14680,2,Its value for money
14681,5,Thank you flipkart
14682,1,The batter back isn‚Äôt good also sometimes it fails to light up when you turn you wrist and you can get better options in this price range
14683,4,1.There was a bit of lag in the software response in touch. The step counter had much difference to the negligible value of error. 2. Connected GPS didn't work well either. It was disconnected most time. 3. The wifi connectivity issue with the device was worst. Most of the watch faces were not able to be downloaded. 4. Notification delay 5. One good thing was that the watch is super light and awesome strap (woven fabric) kind. You don't even feel that you've worn it. 6. Detailed sleep analy...
14684,4,It‚Äôs okay
14685,1,"After few months of use, its not starting. Once its out of warranty its of no use if your watch becomes bad as there is no service center. You mail your probz to customer care they will just feel ""sorry for your inconvenience"" and nothing else. It means in short buying such premium smartwatch has a validity of just 1 year. Go for another brand if you wanna buy Premium smart watches. Disappointed with such products from such big brands. Just a loot."
14686,4,Good So far...Loving it
14687,1,Value for money (Accurate results at every point) look is awesome
14688,5,Very good
14689,5,Classic watch
14690,4,Good product
14691,5,It's wow
14692,4,Classy product.but battery issue seen
14693,5,Nice watch.....
14694,2,"It does the same thing what other smart watches does, high price and less features compared with other watches  I have buy fitbit by watching many review and people are talking about accuracy and correction  I am not expert in reviewing the accuracy of the function but yes I am going to buy another smart watches under 2000 and then I can compare and say why other can take fitbit for 24000, such a huge amount.  3Star for the huge prices only rather is fine"
14695,4,"Awsm product at awsm price , Completely satisfactory. Fitibit is the one u can count on"
14696,5,"The watch looks fine but extra strip can't use as it is little bigger then the original one , can you help me to change ...and replace with new strip"
14697,5,Nice
14698,5,Battery was a bit not satisfactory
14699,2,Nice one
14700,3,Pros- Premium quality Brand value Multiple functions Sleek look Good sensitivity  Cons- Display could have been better; one would expect a better display quality looking at the price of the watch and fitbit brand name attached to it. App interface not very good. Couldn't find the used watch faces.
14701,4,Not good at all. I jave returned the product same day.
14702,1,Don't buy
14703,5,"Hardware is good, but lot of premium features in app."
14704,5,The Product was used and the extra strap was missing and the main strap was also broken
14705,5,Not worth buying it ....screen flickering issue
14706,4,Wonderful bought at 7300
14707,5,Got it in Big billion sale. Positives: Very light . Good software from fit bit tracks all activities. Has an additional belt. Con's: Not the latest features. Many priced below have more features. Only basic steps and heart rate. Strap quality doesn't instill confidence. Plastic feel to the tracker. No GPS/Compass.
14708,5,"Nice watch,but no phone notifications to watch.what is the process to do that."
14709,4,Very often syncing issues and bluetooth connection problems as there are 2 bluetooth connections required.I am disappointed the rest of the watch works fine however the software issues just cuts away the feel and purpose of the watch.
14710,5,Delivered on time. Good one. Looks good.
14711,4,"After a year i al writing this review. I did not use the watch for a month since my strap was broken.. i switched on the watch after the month and it never worked. Tried all possible solutions given in youtube and fibit forum but no luck. Buyers never buy this Fitbit product no service, no support and no guarantee. Spend little more and go with Apple or some other brand.  Seriously the worst product i ever used."
14712,5,Within 8 months display issue started and now it's not working at all and no support from either side.
14713,3,I was very doubtful if this was a right choice. Now I would not regret. Received it today. Set it all up for everything.  Loaded about 100 songs and can play via bluetooth speakers. Best part is I am able to connect to my phone and bluetooth headset at the same time. No difference in quality of sound (actually better than mobile. There is no gap between songs.)  A little time consuming to set up but once done its good to go.  The only thing missing would be inbuilt GPS. Its got everything. No...
14714,5,"Good watch good in quality, precision.  But some how it is not allowing me to update the clock faces and the firmware update is not up to the recent one"
14715,2,Best at this price
14716,5,Good Simple watch.
14717,3,"The only function it does is what a fit band does. Then why pay 10 times more. The message notification function doesn't work properly. And gets removed repeatedly making you reset ur device again and again. The call notification works, but u can't answer ur calls as it doesn't have a inbuilt mic or speaker. It's a total waste of money. Total loss. Requesting for a refund. Also before you buy this product please check on fitbit app if it supports ur device."
14718,1,Nice
14719,2,Very nice üëç all features are nice
14720,4,Sweet techy thing to have... And pretty cute...
14721,1,"Battery discharges within 3 days. You need to pay extra for paid subscription to use the features, the features which are usually bundled with watch purchase."
14722,2,Bike/cycle travelling KMs is not giving if phone not carried. Battery life is also not that good.
14723,5,Pros: 1. Accurate 2. Great community 3. Customisation  Cons: 1. Sync is not all that great. Takes time to get sync 2. Battery drains much faster with always on 3. Accessories are costly
14724,4,I bought versa last year and now it gets problem in Bluetooth and service center not found. Even I have reset the versa but some problem persist.
14725,4,"A smartwatch that works perfectly with both android and iOS. Fitbit has nailed it completely with it's Versa range. The design is sleek, very useful for people who are health-conscious and it offers value for money."
14726,3,"It's not good it's not just complete one year and charger is not working and watch belt is also damage according to cost, material is not good"
14727,4,Very nice really good product
14728,1,Worked well for 6 months and then one day while in use heated up. Burnt the wrist because of battery heating issue.
14729,1,Don't purchase fitbit brand because this is Chinese product. My fitbit watch stopped working after 6 month as well they don't want to exchange.
14730,5,No doubt... It's best in class
14731,5,Good one
14732,5,Worst product
14733,4,After 45 days of use my watch stopped working.. it has been 4 months but my watch is not replaced. No response from customer care. Very bad experience.
14734,1,"Except for logistical delay, everything else was perfect for this pick"
14735,5,Not much as expected
14736,5,Best smartwatch in this prive segment. Period. ...
14737,5,Best in class
14738,3,Worst don't buy it
14739,3,Strap is not durable. Broken within three months of usage. Please do not buy from this seller.
14740,5,This product waste
14741,1,Waste of money . Won't work after 6 months.
14742,5,Waste of money.. doesn't connect easily
14743,2,Do not buy this watch.Waste product.Im unable to sync with my phone.Very pathetic customer support too ..
14744,5,Not worth of the price
14745,1,syncing problem with iphone
14746,1,Amazing watch!
14747,5,"Using since months, watch is okay ok okay but the notifications are not working. Tried all the settings they are sync for some time and got disconnected again. Not sure. Upto fitness tracker I was satisfied."
14748,5,Poor
14749,1,"Bought this in July, calorie counting is like wayyyyyy off it literally shows you more than double calories. I mean who burns 7000 calories after a 6 hour walk.  Edit: Horrible, stopped syncing after 3 months of usage fitness tracking was average but calorie tracking was horrible. No customer support in India. I got and Samsung watch 3 which works like a charm and is overall very accurate in terms of fitness tracking. Don't buy fitbit ever."
14750,1,The watch Is good every thing fine but within 6 months the strap snapped. It was used with utmost care but still the strap just tore.
14751,5,Breakage product
14752,3,The worst thing ever i got in my life. I would rather give minus star rating
14753,5,Watch is undoubtedly good. But the strap is not upto the mark... It tore apart in 4 months
14754,5,Very bad watch charging problem accessories problem and customer care not supported for your problem.zero marking
14755,1,"i bought this watch just bcoz im a fitness enthusiast and wanted to track all the daily routines including my phone notification. after 4 days of using this watch notifications of my phone (including whatsapp, messages etc) has been stopped. i reset my watch is about 3-4 times and the problem is still the same but only one thing which i really like that whenever you workout or do any physical activities, this watch gives you real numbers (including your calories, steps, heart rate, sleep ti..."
14756,1,Bad product Not reading heart rate after 6 months
14757,1,Good product received and worth of money.
14758,1,Totally inaccurate!
14759,1,"Good product, but don't work smoothly with android device"
14760,1,"Nice watch , looks nice but is not a true health tracker. It cannot distinguish between treadmill and walking . Also calorie burn is different from what other machines show"
14761,2,Great watch..durable too
14762,1,Loved it
14763,5,Nice
14764,2,Very nice and so satisfied. Thanks
14765,1,Money waste
14766,1,Look wise it's good...but not accurate. MI band is much more accurate and cheaper comparitively.
14767,5,Nyc
14768,3,Very good product
14769,1,Nice watch
14770,4,Nice product
14771,1,Perfect
14772,2,"it's amazing, just go for it"
14773,5,good
14774,5,not able to connect with mobile and not even getting notifications and calls on my smart watch.not even worth it really unhappy
14775,1,"The watch looks good but the only issue we are facing is with the App. Very often we need to clear the cache and re-login the app, after every login we have to set the notifications."
14776,4,Berry ghatiya product
14777,4,I was not satisfied with this product.. the item was not fair and call notifications will come and message notifications are not come
14778,5,worth to spend on this product
14779,5,perfect...i got very good deal for 9000...it's been 3 months and no issues so far
14780,5,amazing and well fit to customers requirement. best price it was with all other online website.
14781,5,"watch is not at all user friendly. there is no customer care to contact. Please do not waste your money. from the day one i have purchased, synchronisation issue with phone and once i done factory reset, then watch power off for life time. i can not power on from the date i have done factory reset."
14782,2,amazing product
14783,1,Worth it. To keep tracks of your activities.üòä
14784,5,Nice watch.. Gifted wife on our marriage anniversary and she loved it..
14785,5,dont buy this watch. worst product
14786,4,Supergood.
14787,4,best
14788,5,"Product is good. Asthetics are to my taste. Pedometer isn't accurate. If you're traveling in a bus, it will calculate steps due to sheer vibrations. Battery life is good if you are not using notifications or connected GPS.  Now the worst part - Fitbit doesn't have a single service center any where in the world. So if you damage this watch, you will have to buy a new one. Period."
14789,5,nice
14790,4,Papa is very happy with the watch
14791,1,Full stylish ‚ù§Ô∏è
14792,3,"belt looks decent, but does not fit with the watch pins. You won't be able to use it."
14793,5,Amazing!! You can make your selfie pic as a clock background which feels just so good.
14794,3,it has some of technical issues like notification problem and it take lot of time to load maps.
14795,4,"synchronisation issue, good one to use"
14796,5,battery life is a serious problem.. after on update the battery does not last for even one full day.. been using amazefit.. it's so much better than this one..
14797,5,super
14798,1,"The watch doesn't show the notification of call or message, it always says pair the phone even after pairing the same, raised this issue to Fitbit multiple times, but no response yet."
14799,5,Very nice Fitbit Versa Smartwatch
14800,5,great product
14801,5,I just have praises for this watch
14802,1,base users for a activity trackers
14803,5,loving it.
14804,5,"Overall a good smartwatch. 24x7 heart rate monitor, notifications.. working perfectly with Galaxy M30s. Only negative is step counter is inaccurate."
14805,2,my product is not returned yet. how can the issue be resolved
14806,5,"Connectivity is totally disgusting, notifications never work. Cheaper Chinese watches are better in this regard"
14807,5,good in all aspects.
14808,5,There is a discolouration problem in 1 month. I am highly disappointed by flipkart and fitbit
14809,2,While calculating floors and exercise duration. It's highly inaccurate !!! So accuracy which is the main thing is major issue. Battery backup is good which is 3+ days.  Stopped working in 4 months only. And fitbit take a very very long time to replace your watch.
14810,5,ok
14811,3,"I am using this product from last 2 months, I am using oneplus 6 Mobile. 1) Connectivity Issues ( every time i use to go to settings and reconnect again) 2) Find My Device/Watch not available ( even MI band have this feature) 3) Only to view time and Fitness activities thats it. ( while going in bike also its counting the steps). Instead of this you can buy Mi Band to go with Fitness Activities and time."
14812,5,"Amazing product with one major flaw, it does not play stored songs properly through bluetooth speakers or earphones. The music either plays too fast or too slow. The only difference between versa and versa lite is versas song storage facility which in a way is waste as it does not play properly. save money go for versa lite."
14813,1,very good product...
14814,5,Connectivity issue.
14815,5,excellent watch...only issue is the charger has something inside which sounds something loose..but itz working
14816,4,The battery is not such a log lasting as given.lt give backup up to 80 hours
14817,5,super watch and nice color
14818,5,Awesome. Very Good watch in the category. Light in weight.
14819,4,good one
14820,5,"Not so great!! decent on external, very primitive inside!! light-years to catch-up with what Apple watch offers!! Except for the price, pretty disappointed!!"
14821,4,There is some variance between actual steps and fitbit count...but over all its a superb product
14822,1,very bad.step count incorrect always. waste of money
14823,1,not as expected. 1. Sleep data not correct. 2. Wrist belt is irritating. 3. poor battery. 4. many features are paid and synchronisation after many failed attempt. poor connectivity. .
14824,4,good product fantastic delivery and price by Flipkart thank you Flipkart
14825,1,good one
14826,2,good and accurate
14827,4,It does not have built in GPS and it does not calculate distance accurately. It also does not have walk option in the exercises.
14828,1,very good
14829,4,worst wate of money dont buy display problem with in 20 days it was dead
14830,5,Really good watch worth buying
14831,1,Got it for reasonable price on big billion day..Just after few days of usage the smart watch is getting synced but display is not working..Raised concern to fitbit and replacement order was placed.Did not expect such poor quality from Fitbit.
14832,4,"notification service does not runs on my device, always shows an error message in a red banner in the fitbit app"
14833,2,worth buying....
14834,5,Charger stopped working within 10 days of purchase. Please do some quality checks before handling the product
14835,5,No meeting my expectation as it is not compatible with one plus 5 and it is not mentioned on the app.
14836,4,working as per review but little costly
14837,2,watch is good but app not working properly.. some times i am not able to see notifications in fitbit..
14838,4,Not as expected due to connectivity issues that it has with my one plus phone. Otherwise it is fine but not a value for money buy as spending 8000 for this watch is waste. Could be a steal if available at 4k.
14839,2,nice product....
14840,1,Not worth the price. Step tracking is inaccurate. The band adds car and bike ride as steps. Didn‚Äôt expect this from Fitbit
14841,5,perfect for health reasons
14842,5,super product and delivery on Time üëç
14843,5,go for it guys rocking
14844,2,the Charger is not working and it‚Äôs only been 21 days since I bought it. I don‚Äôt want to recommend it. High risk
14845,5,excellent fitness tracker and a fancy watch
14846,1,In just 5 months this watch stopped working! Requested from Fitbit for replacement and the procedure is so confusing! Not worth the money paid
14847,4,Fantastic watch ..specially for fitness
14848,1,very nice watch received two days before the delivery date and awesome features .
14849,1,awesome product happy to buy this üëç
14850,5,Not good product. Starting for about 10days it was showing correct data. After that it show same results of bpm of all
14851,1,good
14852,1,it's not connected to mobile for calls and messages alerr
14853,3,is it compatible to one plus 5T...i am facing compatible problem.
14854,3,Wonderful Watch with wonderful price..
14855,3,it's not a smart watch which can receive or reply to phone call or WhatsApp message it's a normal fitness band
14856,5,great product
14857,1,"It doesn't feel like a premium watch. Also, the sensors that wake it up are less effective, One has to shake the wrist to wake it up"
14858,5,doesn't support notifications in one plus 6
14859,5,Very nice smart watch. I got in the big billion days . Delivery was on time.
14860,5,very good product with great features
14861,1,good watch.... only lacking call facility
14862,4,Loving this watch thanks to Flipkart for such offer.
14863,1,Counts steps while driving as well as just moving hand back and forth. Expected a lot better product at this price
14864,5,Everytime I'll have to update my watch and it takes like 5 years to update üò†
14865,5,expectation is more while buying but after wearing the smart watch it didn't reach the level very difficult to add a Bluetooth device and adding songs.....
14866,5,Everything is good except I received Chinese variant of the device and the connectivity issue with OP6T
14867,1,"Monitor whole day, involvement and monitoring is design perfectly that make you busy and conscious about losing weight burning calories , listing music as well as controlling breathing & BPM"
14868,4,The product was not as per expectation.
14869,2,genuine product
14870,1,Great product
14871,5,Durablity is good but walking step is not accurate
14872,1,Nice Watch for the Amount
14873,5,awesome.....
14874,2,"Unfortunately I couldn't get any option to get notifications in my Redmi phone..Kindly help..if it doesn't support ,then it will be a waste of money for me!"
14875,4,Excellent product... good to go
14876,5,nice product
14877,4,"i am kind of unhappy wit this , other features are good bt it isn't appropriate atall. sometimes it automatically increases steps while being on rest mode , the fun fact is i remove my watch and sleep amd the other day i see 500 calories burned like i didn't even wear it"
14878,4,Flipkart has provided me a faulty piece or the watch itself is faulty. It is not able to get the notification from my phone. Tried a lot. worst product
14879,5,worst watch
14880,2,stylish and fantastic
14881,1,ok
14882,1,excellent watch
14883,3,best price and good buy
14884,5,the reason why I am giving 4 is it is not syncing with my phone automatically.
14885,2,come with more than expected features.ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞love it.
14886,5,"delivery was so poor, item is nice"
14887,5,Good

14889,5,disconnects very frequently with my one plus 6 and then again takes 30minutes to add again ! and doesn't show any notifications! and delivery took 12 days ! worst buy ever !

14894,2,It's nice but it's Chinese variant
14895,1,Nice watch

14943,4,"Inferior product - one of the worst from Dell. Even a laptop screen second hand is better than this. Inferior quality LCD screen parts used. Display has round white marks within 10 days. Reducing clarity of display of numbers. Not recommended to use for work/business purposes.  Power plug send with this item is not of Indian standard. It is a very large power plug, send on purpose so that the return policy of 10 days will lapse."

14965,4,Amazing screen quality and brightness. The touch response is also very good. Highly recommended in that price...
14966,4,Awosome!!
14967,5,Couldn't connect to monitor as the power cord provided is of 15 Amps plug and normally we switch to 5amp plug.
14968,2,The monitor is good. It come with the power connector which is used for high voltage items and it will not fit in a normal 3 pin plug. Yoh need a bigger plug which is used for AC for this cord. Have purchased another connector from market for it to fit in the standard extension cord.
14969,4,"Viewing Angle is just average; It's strange that the monitor requires 16A Socket, therefore doesn't fit in the normal socket; Not LED, the display is LCD, Title is misguiding the consumers; The package was already opened by the seller; Average HDMI cable, the display looks blurred using HDMI Cable; Made in China, the printed manufacturing date was Oct'20, can't speak about its reliability at this point; Other Points: Comes with HDMI Cable and VGA Cable for respective ports, along with 3.5mm A..."

15197,5,It is a amazing monitor. It supports fhd and suitable for you gaming consoles or pc.
15198,5,"This is a very standard 18.5 inches Monitor from Dell. There is one important information needs to be added that the power source cable of the monitor comes with a 16A plug and it is not possible to connect to our standard UPS. Hence either the cable needs to be replaced or the monitor needs to be connected to 16A plug point, which will not help during power cut. Due to this, I have not yet been able to check/test the visuals and performance of the monitor. Hope to update my review soon once ..."

15235,5,Excellent product.. delivery was on time.. delivery person behavior was too good..I am very much satisfied with the product ??
15236,4,"Overall I am quite satisfied and happy with the monitor. The only reason I am give 4 star is due to the fact that the power cable that this monitor uses is a 16A one. This was a surprise as I did not expect a monitor to have a 16A input cable l. Had to buy a converter to get it working. This delayed the use by couple of days more. But other than that, this is a very good buy"

15284,5,Good
15285,5,"Product is good. It was available for Rs 500 less next day after ordering so felt cheated. Also beware it has 16A power cord (which is used for devices like Refrigerator, Washing machine) so it wont fit in your regular socket."
15286,3,The power plug/pin is too big.. does not fit anywhere. It's bigger than required for a refrigerator. Don't know why it requires so much power. ..The monitor is just okay but worth the price

15482,3,"It serves the purpose and it is beautiful. Let‚Äôs start the review with delivery. It was fast but the package box was a huge square shaped one with package inside. When I opened it and found the screen is beautiful and sleek. The packaging contained:- 1)vga cable 2) HDMI cable 3) stand for screen 4) screen 5) power cable 6) CD (I don‚Äôt know why I could not find CD drives on most of the latest laptops) So, it was easy to setup and I was able to do it in less than 5 mins.

15484,5,"Before describing the monitor itself, I want to mention that I am extremely pleased by the seller and delivery. I ordered this on Saturday afternoon and I had it with me on Sunday afternoon. Fastest delivery that I've ever had.  The box comes with a HDMI and a VGA cable. The screen has a very basic I/O: Just one for VGA and HDMI each. No speakers on the monitor. The monitor stand is fixed, cannot be adjusted for height or swivel. That said, it looks very nice on my desk. The screen is very sl..."
15485,5,Awesome display just replaced it with my old 768p monitor. It looks very premium with perfect sharpness and good colour reproduction. I use it mostly for gaming at 1080p with gtx 1060 6gb easily pulling 60 fps on most new games. One good advantage is that due to nvidia 's dsr super scaling and it being a 1080p monitor i can increase the resolution to 4k and all games support it. At 4k the display even though downsampled to 1080p looks just stunning but my gtx 1060 can not handle 4k. It can on...
15486,5,"Very slick. I think there is no other monitor available in market with that much slickness. Left, right and top bezels are black colored, very narrow (little lesser than half inch) and covered by panel's glass. Bottom bezel is lesser than 1"", silver colored and looks quite stylish. Stand is silver colored, slick and stylish. Back side is black and mat-finished - looks stylish. I was a bit skeptical of buying a 27"" monitor for my programming work; but now I am satisfied since it doesn't look t..."
15487,5,"Perfect aspect ratio , colours are good . Slim and sleek design . Best in this price range ."
15488,4,"Not five star because the response time is not suitable for gaming purposes therefore it is a general purpose monitor. Hope this helps. Brightness is good, and its a good one at this price specially impressed by the 3 year guarantee claim made by the dealer."
15489,5,Nice monitor it has a good viewing angles and it is the best in its segment. And even looks royal with the aluminium coloured frame and slim enough too I recommend you to go for it.... It's packing is also good and it has VGA and HDMI Cables too....
15490,5,Got this beauty at just 9300. A pretty good deal for a 24inch IPS monitor. Great color production and the looks pretty slick.
15491,5,Amazing Value For Money Monitor  I Use This Excellent Display 15 Days Amazing Response  (1) HDMI Cable (2) Amazing Screen (3) power Cable
15492,5,Awesome product. Nice display. Gives some flickering in screen if connected via VGA but crystal clear clarity if connected via HDMI. Worth buying and value for money.
15493,4,"I've been using it since a year and here is my conclusion... the display is very good colours are accurate and the resolution is really full hd and it gives full screen experience, just the bezel at the bottom is a bit annoying. there are some difference in colours of monitor and smartphone or other device but I noticed it in every monitor. all and all it's a good product, you should try it out."
15494,5,"I really wanted this screen when I first saw this on FK and Amzn. It's super slim and has awesome display. And the offers on Flipkart were great so I couldn't resist. If anyone wants screen of 21.5"" then I would say this is the screen they should go for. Samsung and LG has TN panels in this price range and HP has come up with IPS display which is far better than any other TN panels. If you are a hard core gamer then I suggest to go with a TN panel with low G2G response time. This panel has ..."
15495,4,"Very Stylish Design. Great Looks. Good Picture Quality. Only missing thing is a speaker. Coz when you connect to HDMI, the audio output from a laptop would not work then."

15499,5,"I purchased On Big billion day .. at cost of Rs 7100 /-  1. It's was amazing packing and delivery. 2. The monitor consists of HDMI cable, Monitor Stand, power cable and Monitor. 3. Very slim you can adjust the monitor as you like very stylish. 4. 100 % satisfied I refer others to buy this product.  Thank you"
15500,5,"Do not think twice before purchasing it some will say lg display is good samsung is better, it has a response time of 7 ms which is slower than usual and u are here searching for an IPS panel monitor it clears that u want a good picture quality and video experience so go for it don't listen to any other if u take it then u will give a review here like me.."
15501,5,"Flipkart really went an extra mile this time! I am happy that they have started delivering their products to Srinagar, J& K also. The consignment was well packed and courier guy was also very polite and helpful. Will surely buy more if Flipkart also starts delivering other items like fridges, washing machines and Televisions etc to our area. Very happy with the purchase."
15502,5,"The monitor is an absolute value for money. IPS panel, full HD at this price point is a steal. HP products are reliable. Playing games on it is aan altogether different experience. To top it all, large display helps to do office tasks easily. Flipkart delivery and packaging was prompt and top class."
15503,4,"Very Good Product. I bought this product 26 Jan 2017 and i got at home 29 Jan afternoon at my door step. No Extra fragile used for this product. This LED powered with power adapter and adapter have not any HP made mark or logo, i dont know Is this original or not. But Result is awesome and product pure new and original and fulfill my wish."
15504,5,"It's a good product (only been 1 week though, will update later on). Looks good. Works well. Sleek, light weight.  Following are some nit-picking from the initial experience: Not easily accessible ports (These are behind screen; hidden).It could have been way better if these would have been on the side. The stand is good looking, but not practical. It's not height adjustable."
15505,4,"Awsome quality, best moniter in this price, perfect & true color for photo & video, best moniter for photoshop working & video editing.. Loved it.. Thanku flipkart.. Flipkart service is very good before time delivery i loved it."
15506,5,The HP 22Es Monitor is actually pretty good and have VGA and HDMI cables bundled with it already and is very much sleek considering it already a 2 year old product. Got it for 7100/- during the BBDs and its totally worth that.
15507,5,This monitor has very thin bezel and full hd resolution and better viewing angle. I am greatly impressed with the design of this product and monitor looks stunning on the desk. I have paired it up with HP pavilion wave desktop CPU and it is over all a great looking desktop for me. The monitor is priced very well and offers excellent value for money.
15508,5,It was nice but the white metal finished bottom was not good. I thought it will good at looks when I saw it in online good but it was not good enough. For me it spoils the screen while watching movies. I recommend you to buy fully black colore finished moniter
15509,5,"Nice Slim Display, very good colors and uses very less space compared with other Displays. One word to the product is very nice to use this display"
15510,5,"Magnificent, it‚Äôs a spectacular piece of a product. Really happy that I have purchased due to the wfh situation and it is indeed turning out to be a great choice as I expected. The built and finishing of this brilliant monitor asks for your admiration. Just get it on and enjoy the anti glare beauty of vivid Colors."
15511,5,"I have been using this monitor for last 1 year and no compliant so far. I use it for my daily work and also connect with my office laptop.  However, there are few improvement areas which I feel could have been added to this one:  1. This is not height adjustable 2. The Power cable is too thin. You need to pay special attention to avoid cut 3. No USB or Speaker"
15512,4,"Seller: RetailNet On time delivery. Packing is just okay. Nice looking monitor. Working good. Advertised as 3 years warranty product but I got only two and half years warranty after registration with HP website. Missing 6 months warranty. Feel like Default display is too bright. So I had to adjust display settings. No complaints with Monitor. No missing accessories. VGA cable,HDMI cable and warranty card are included with the package. Monitor looks pretty good."
15513,5,Happy to see the things u like on the big screen with affordable price. Thank u flip kart and hp
15514,5,very very good monitor.. love this monitor..this monitor look is very cool ...very slim..and thank for hp this monitor sell low budget..
15515,5,"The monitor display is amazing. It's very slim and light weight. Looks absolutely stunning. VGA and HDMI cables are provided with the monitor. It definitely works as PnP and it's very easy to mount.  Cons: The one star less is for the quality of the power cord. The half part of the cable which connects the adapter and the monitor is of poor quality, looks like the cable that you can buy with the Diwali lights."
15516,5,this is the best product and super quality Super clarity
15517,5,"This is the best product I bought on flipkart and I am so happy with my decision. This laptop is just awesome. 1. Built- 5/5 2. Screen 5/5 3. Looks 5/5 4. Battery life with normal uses around 6-7 hours- 5/5 5. Performance 5/5 6. Sound - 5/5. 7. CPU heat near 35 d C at normal uses. Also there is option to increase/decrease fan speed. Which is helpful to cool down the CPU. - 5/5 8. Value for money compare to other laptop, probably best."
15518,5,Amazing picture quality. Great for working and editing. The color production is very good. Also the Led is very sleek and looks very good.
15519,5,It's amazingly superb product in this price. Thanks to flipkart and the packing also very good with the additional large box for extra safety with the fragile item inside warning. It's delivered well before the expected date. Thank you flipkart
15520,5,Its good product. However choose Dell because they have very good sharpness and comes with speakers with good sound quality. I have both ips full HD monitor. I suggest you to go with dell monitor when you get in lower price in sale.  However its also good monitor i got in 6750 in sale price at very good price. Thank you Flipkart
15521,4,Worth For Money... Good Display... Best For Gaming And Movies Watching... Thin Bezzels... Awesome Product...

15523,4,Nice monitor.... U get 100% video output result Oly by using Graphics card.... Without graphics card video is very poor. After by using graphics card I get 4k video clarity very nice. .. I am satisfied by this monitor.....
15524,5,"Fantastic, fabulous and exactly what I want in a monitor. built quality was excellent sharp and beautiful design. colour depth are bright and very good for designing work like Photoshop."
15525,4,"Technicolor certified and there is a picture mode for that. Hence screen is vibrant and good for movies. Physical design (narrow bezel and metal stand) is also good. Good viewing angle . Got it for ‚Çπ6,699 during Big Billion sale. Worth the money  Cons  No 3.5mm output No inbuilt speaker Blacks are not dark enough when compared to Oled screens and high quality LCD screen seen in phones such as iPhone XR. But the screen produces decent blacks. Not bad."
15526,5,"overall product good , this is non vesa mount led so you can't mount directly .. you want to need vesa adapter and it's very light weight so not stable in fan wind on table."
15527,5,At the price of Rs.6600 this will be the best full HD monitor from the best PC brand HP. Viewing angles are awesome and colors are so vivid. At last the build quality is good and the monitor itself is very slim. Thanks to flipkart for giving me this offer. Flipkart never disappoints me :)
15528,4,Awesome product. I was not expecting this high quality product within this price. Best packing quality and delivery from flipcart. This monitor looks suoerb. Happy with my purvhase. Within the Box Got everything that was mentioned. HDMI connectivity working great.
15529,4,"This was for my friend. He is professional photo editor. He loves the display and the crisp clear image. Must buy if your looking for good display output similar to almost that of an iMac. It's too thin , so have to handle with careüòÄ."
15530,5,"Very Light weight, Sleek, Elegant looking monitor with bright colors and good viewing angles. Plug & Play. Packaged well and dispatched promptly too. Price could be a bit more competitive though."

15541,5,Delivery was good it was on time. Setup and connection to laptop took just 10 min from opening to using the screen. Definitely sleek and very lightweight. Blue light single click reduction is a good feature for those who believe blue light at night may cause less sleep  But: the website says authorised technician should install to ensure 10 day replacement guarantee but when i called up support they said I can install it myself. Then why say this on the website.  The swivel is only up and dow...
15542,4,It's really great led monitor i liked it very much thank you
15543,5,Good for Home use. Stunned by seeing 1080p youtube videos. Speciality is that you can watch videos without black bars. Thinnest IPS LED monitor I have ever seen. No other option in this price range. I got it exchanged with Samsung LCD monitor. Nothing to say. Go for it. I got it for ‚Çπ8099 after exchange.  Don't know why Flipkart ships without any sort of packaging. Just a sticker pasted on the cover. Expected better packaging from Flipkart.
15544,5,"Super fast delivery by Flipkart, Got in hand in 13 hours. appreciated......  Monitor feels excellent and beautiful so far (2 days of usage)."

15585,5,This is the most pathetic monitor i have used . Hp in monitors is a real pain. Major issue is with the hdmi cable. Gives the error check cable.. and then after a month the buttons on the monitor started working automatically.. total waste of money.. may be with a single piece overall m nt sure though.. your call

Free HDMI And VGA ( I guess not exactly free since you're paying but not many companies like apple ( which suck ) do this.  Also, Old school people still use VGA so don't complain about it dear.

15601,5,This product is fantastic. This HP monitor is too good
15602,4,"I bought it in Sep 2017, and now I can see the spots every where on the screen. I merely used it for 50 hours max.  *** Update 27/05/2020 ***  My monitor has changed thrice already, programmers stay away from this fancy model.  HP support is worst, you have to call them tons of time for onsite support."

15606,5,"Highlight recommended to those who wants to upgrade their monitor to 22"". You surely fell in love with this product after opening the packing. I Hope this information helps the new buyers."
15607,5,I am HP fan from my heart but the color of this display is not that crispy as AOC LM525. I thought it is going to be crystal clear but this display failed me. After using 45 days I can say It is not as it was expected to be. :(
15608,5,Actual quality of the product is revealed after 2 weeks of usage. Power button is not at all working. Monitor menu automatically working on its own. Can't even able to stop it. None of the monitor's menu button is in control. Just an incredible product. Selling defective products for offer???

15618,5,3 MONTHS usage I have to give only 1 star because the product is malfunctioning and does not work properly. Cannot get hold of HP team also. contacted 10 times to finally reach someone and who said that I have to call a different number. FLIPKART- You should also take care about the quality and warranty support technical details.
15619,1,nice
15620,4,"I bought this monitor for my Home office. It is so smooth and crisp. I bought it under 11000/- , a bit higher for my price range and was a stretch for me, but this is beautiful.
